        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>The history and events of Chateaugay and Chateaugay Lake are very closely related and interconnected. The Chateaugay Lakes area has a fascinating and event-filled past that merits a detailed treatment and much attention by local historians.  Today, there are several websites that contain historical material on the Lakes. </p>

<p>Throughout the years, many articles have also been written in various local and national newspapers and magazines. This wealth of information is all priceless.  I am currently compiling material that will contain around twenty five first-person accounts of the earliest sporting visits to the lakes. They are filled with vivid descriptions of what the “sports” experienced while either plying the waters for trout and whitefish or traveling the woods in search of deer and other game. </p>

<p>Two more recent books: Chateaugay Lakes by Herman and Ruth Whalen © 1997 and Chateaugay Lake: The Resort Era 1830-1917 by Henry C. Ruschmeyer © 2010 are longer treatments of Chateaugay Lake history and are treasure troves of information, memories and captivating characters.</p>

<p>Rev. Ruschmeyer’s book has proven to be the definitive work on the various hotels that served guests on the lakes.  He has exhaustively documented the history of the lodgings and visitors to the area and traces the various stages of resort development over almost 90 years. His detail and analysis of the “Resort Era” is unmatched.</p>

<p>With deference to Rev. Ruschmeyer, this blog post is a “Cliffs Notes” version, or a primer of sorts, of the resort hotels and their various names and incarnations. In discussions over the years, I’ve heard questions like; “Which hotel was Morrisons?” or “What was the Interlaken?” or “Was it the Merrill House that was also known as Young’s?”</p>  

<p>It can be easy to lose track of which hotel was which, due to the various changes in ownership/operators and business names.</p> 

<p>There were six major, commercial accommodations on the lakes during the “Resort Era”, but they were known by a total of some twenty different names over the years.  This blog post is neither a comprehensive nor detailed look at these resorts, but rather a quick reference as to which name goes to which hotel, when the names changed and, specifically, where the five Upper Lake hotels were located.</p>  

<p>For the in-depth story of Chateaugay Lake and the “golden age of visitors”, we are, indeed, fortunate to be able to turn to works like Chateaugay Lake: The Resort Era 1830-1917.</p>

<p>The very first resort hotel on Chateaugay Lake became known to later generations as the Banner House. Located on the Lower Lake and built about thirty years before the Civil War, it was the only true resort on northernmost lake. There were a few cottages that took guests, but the Banner House was the only larger accommodation dedicated solely to guests each season.</p>  

<p><b><u>Bellows House → Bellows Lake House → Chateaugay Lake House → Banner House</b></u></p>

<p>Construction was begun in the late 1830’s by Jonathan Bellows. This is the original commercial accommodation on the lakes. It was variously referred to as the “Bellows House”, the “Bellows Lake House” or the “Chateaugay” or the “Chateaugay Lake House” until it was purchased from Bellows’ grandson, Millard, by A.M. Bennett and J.S. Kirby in 1891 and renamed the “Banner House”.  Kirby eventually bought out Bennett’s share. Fred W. Adams later became owner, followed by the Chase family who operated it for 4 generations.  Capacity: approx. 75</p>

<hr>

<p>The map shown here places the five resorts located on the Upper Lake. The Banner House on the Lower Lake is easily the most visible of the six hotels; sitting across Route 374 and overlooking the water. These five on the Upper Lake were less visible to the casual traveler. Below are brief sketches of each along with the various names attached to them over the years. The number for each resort coincides with the number on the accompanying map.</p>

<h4>1. MERRILL HOUSE → YOUNGS</h4>

<p>Built in the late 1860’s by Darius Merrill and run by him for over twenty years, it was sold to Oliver Young in 1890 and the name was changed. Young enlarged the hotel and installed indoor plumbing throughout. It was considered an excellent “family style hotel”; clean, pleasant and comfortable with an “excellent table”. Young operated it well into the 20th century, through the end of the “Resort Era”. The building eventually burned in November, 1979 following several years of disuse. Capacity: approx. 75</p>

<h4>2. HOTEL INTERLAKEN → CHATEAUGAY HOTEL → THE CHATEAUGAY → OWLYOUT LODGE</h4>

<p>Originally constructed in the early 1890’s, it was more of a “big city hotel” than the existing establishments were.  It was built basically “next door” to the Merrill House. In 1892, Charles W. Backus bought the Interlaken from Wat Merrill and renamed it the “Chateaugay Hotel” or simply, the “Chateaugay”.  In 1902, Backus had financial difficulties and lost the hotel.  Alys Bentley and a business partner bought the hotel and the three acre property for $4,000 and renamed it the “Owlyout Lodge”.  It burned in 1908 and was never rebuilt. Capacity: approx. 100</p>

<h4>3. LAKE VIEW HOUSE</h4>

<p>This hostelry was conducted in Charlie Merrill’s home much like a bed and breakfast might be today. It was the smallest but, probably, the most intimate of the lodging choices found on the Lakes. It was located south of the Owlyout Hotel. The Charlie Merrill family placed ads in local newspapers as well as in several New York City papers.</p>

<p>This hotel was listed in the “Adirondack Hotels – Circa 1860 to 1930”, and in The Descriptive Guide to the Adirondacks… ©1894 by E.R. Wallace.  In each case, C.E. Merrill is listed as the proprietor and its capacity is noted at 35 guests. </p>  

<p>Wallace’s description reads: The Lake View House is pleasantly located near the shore, 60 rods from the Interlaken [later the Owlyout Lodge], and commands a prospect similar in picturesqueness to that disclosed by the other resorts named. It offers entertainment to 35 guests, at moderate rates.</p> 

<p>The Lake View House was not discussed in the previously mentioned Chateaugay Lake: The Adirondack Resort Era 1830 – 1917.</p>

<h4>4. THE ADIRONDACK HOUSE → TUPPER’S HOTEL → RALPH’S → MORRISON’S → SUNSET INN</h4>

<p>Built in 1872 by Captain Tupper, this hotel was the largest on the lake and was operated as the “Adirondack House” during the early years.  In 1878, it was purchased by a Doctor Ralph from Malone who enlarged it to accommodate 125 guests and renamed, appropriately, “Ralph’s”. In 1907 Andrew Morrison became the new proprietor and, again, changed the name. In 1920, it changed hands yet again and, under the new ownership of Arthur T. Smith from Montreal, became the “Sunset Inn”. Several other owners followed Smith. The hotel eventually closed in 1940 and was demolished in 1943. Capacity: approx. 125. There is a more in-depth description of this hotel in an earlier blog post, dated September 10, 2021.</p>

<h4>5. FOREST HOUSE → MCPHERSON’S → THE MCPHERSON HOUSE → INDIAN POINT HOUSE</h4>

<p>Around 1852, a man named Eben McPherson built a number of “shanties” on Indian Point and hosted guests. The property was leased to George W. Collins for a time just before it was eventually sold to Richard Shutts in the early 1880s. The Indian Point House was among the smallest and most intimate of the commercial hotels on the lake. It was built in 1882 by Dick Shutts.  It consisted of a main building and several cottages. This resort was also the most inaccessible, only reachable by boat. Upon “Uncle” Dick Shutts death in 1921, the family attempted to keep the business going.  However, the main lodge burned in 1923.  The property and the remaining cottages were later purchased by Fay Welch and become “Tanager Lodge”, a summer camp for children in 1925. Tanager Lodge is still operates today. Capacity: approx. 40.</p>

<hr>

<p>Chateaugay Lake was served by trains on the Chateaugay Railroad that stopped in Lyon Mountain, about four miles distant, and by trains on the Rutland Railroad that stopped in Chateaugay village, about nine miles away.  Both stations were connected to the lake by well-maintained roads and continuous stage service on comfortable Concord coaches.</p>

<p>When all six of the Chateaugay Lake resorts were filled to capacity, there could be some 450 guests enjoying both lakes and all they had to offer.</p>
