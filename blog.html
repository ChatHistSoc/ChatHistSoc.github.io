        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>I have been researching the water system in the Village of Chateaugay recently and have amassed some interesting facts about the earliest pipes laid throughout the community.</p>

<p>The earliest and most inexpensive water pipes were of wood. Long, straight trees were cut into various lengths (most commonly between six and ten feet long) and were bored through the center with a long steel auger bit. Depending on the size of the bit used, the hole down the length of the log would typically be an inch to an inch and a half in diameter.</p>

<p>This simple method was the most labor efficient. To make joints, one end of a bored log would be sharpened to a tapered end and inserted into the flat end of the log laid before it. The bored hole in the flat-ended log would be enlarged slightly so that when the pointed end was driven in, the diameter of the hole was not constricted and the flow of water impeded.</p> 

<p>This process would be repeated and lines laid under the streets. It was a simple matter of drilling into the line to attach smaller, branch lines which fed homes and businesses.</p>

<p>The tapered joints could be sealed with pine tar or other material, but most often were left “dry” and without sealant since, when the pipes were filled with moving water, the wood fibers would swell and the joint became water tight.</p>

<p>In our area, cedar, pine, hemlock, or even elm were most often used, although any long, straight-grained tree could serve this purpose. These lines could last well over a hundred years without rotting as there were never any appreciable levels of oxygen available to allow rot to take place. The outside of the pipes was surrounded by soil and fill that would soon compact and seal the outer surfaces, and the inside of the pipe was always filled with water.</p>

<p>This is the same circumstance shown on some reality shows on cable tv with present-day loggers harvesting old, downed trees from the beds of large open rivers. In many cases, the trees have been underwater for decades (maybe even centuries), but when brought up and dried, can be sawed up and milled into perfectly good lumber.</p>

<p>Back to wooden water lines—another example of early, wooden pipes is much more labor intensive. This involves “stave” pipes, which were assembled from long chamfered pieces of lumber (think long barrel-like construction) which were bound around the outside with either a coarse wire or flat metal bands. This process was a refinement of the bored log system and was only used if the community laying the lines had the resources and money to pay for the added labor and related expenses involved.</p>

<p>Evidently, one of the advantages of wooden pipes in communities was when fighting fires. If the pipe was readily accessible, it was an easy process to drill into the pipe, insert a hose end and have water available to fight a blaze. To seal the pipe again, it was simply a matter of driving a round plug into the newly-drilled hole in the side of the pipe. Thus, the origin of the term; “fire plug”.</p>

<p>How does this all apply to Chateaugay? To start at the beginning of the process, as they say; the Village was incorporated in 1868. In the earliest days of the community, every home had their own hand-dug well (or cistern or brook, etc.) as a water source and were responsible for their own water supply for daily life.</p> 

<p>Shortly after the incorporation, plans were made for a municipal water system, although the actual water line network would come later. Finally, in 1880, a water line network was begun in the Village by the Chateaugay Waterworks Company, using wooden piping. It appears that the bored pipe method was used in these earliest lines.</p> 

<p>This system worked well for decades but eventually metal pipes began to replace the older, wooden sections of the waterworks—partly to replace sections in need of repair, or to build entirely new lines, but more importantly, to increase water volume to the growing community with larger capacity lines.</p>

<p>Although metal pipes had largely replaced the wooden lines during the early years of the 20th Century, within the last twenty years or so, sections of wooden pipes have even been dug up on Iron Avenue when water line work was being done there. So, there were (or maybe still are) a few short sections of wooden pipe carrying water in the village into the present-day.</p>

<p>In 2018, Tony Green, who was then the maintenance supervisor at the local milk plant, called me up and told me of some wooden pipes unearthed at the end of Collins Street where the plant had some construction underway. He took photos of some of the log lines after they were pulled from the ground and then sawed sections that showed the bored water line and a tapered end that was used in a pipe joint. He turned the sawed examples over to the Historical Society.</p>

<p>Eight photos are featured above: three that Tony took, two images of the sawed sections in our Archival Center, followed by three Google Images that show a stave pipe with the outer wrappings, a good view of wooden pipes jointed with a tapered, pointed joint, and a photo showing how the logs would be bored with a long metal bit.</p> 

<p>So, the first five images are of local, Chateaugay Village wooden pipes and the last three are stock images from the internet showing pipe details.</p>

<p>On a personal note, my Dad was a plumber at the mines in Chateaugay as a young man. As a youngster, I often helped him when he did plumbing for others or at our home. I remember having to help thread pipes, coating the new threads with pipe dope to help seal them, and tighten the fittings using pipe wrenches, or helping to seal the bell joints in Orangeburg sewer pipes by pounding oakum into the joint and sealing it with melted lead. All very labor intensive, for sure.</p>

<p>When thinking about plumbing and how it has progressed from lead and iron pipes, copper, plastic, and now ultra-modern systems like Sharkbite and Pex; it is interesting to see how the plumbing trade certainly has undergone amazing changes in materials, techniques, and processes.</p>

<p>And to think that the local materials used to run the earliest water pipes in the village were just the trees growing here…</p>

        <p>With a bit of snow forecast for the middle of the week, I thought we would look a little farther into winter. This photo was brought into the Archival Center by Edith Lopardo.</p>

<p>It is undated but was taken at the rink on River Street before the new school was built.</p>

<p>Note how the ladies are clad in dress coats and hats as they watch the skaters.</p>

        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>This blog post had its beginnings in a conversation I had with Geri Favreau, president of the Clinton County Historical Association, about an ecclesiastical painter named Angelo Metallo who did murals at the former St. Philomena’s/Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Churubusco and in St. Patrick’s Church in Rouses Point. It turns out that he also did painting at St. Patrick’s in Chateaugay. Who knew?? According to the August 17, 1928 issue of the <i>Chateaugay Record</i>, Professor Metallo was “decorating the interior of St. Patrick’s” and would be moving on to a similar contract at the church in Churubusco.</p>

<p>Naturally, I went back into our files to see if there was any information about paintings that were done at St. Patrick’s in Chateaugay. I found many photos of the Catholic Churches in Chateaugay over the years but nothing about any specific murals or scenes. I took some new photos of the present church and decided while the research into Professor Metallo continues, and a post (or newsletter article) about him and his works will eventually appear, that I would do a blog post on the three Catholic Churches that have been on West Main Street over the last 178 years—with photos.</p>

<p>The first was built in 1844 by Father James Keveny of Hogansburg. Masses were said in the new church very intermittently due to the large territory that Father Keveny had to minister to. The local church and the one in Malone were mission churches of Hogansburg until 1848. Chateaugay then became a mission of the newly formed St. Joseph’s Parish in Malone with Father Bernard McCabe as pastor. St. Patrick's Church of Chateaugay was officially incorporated under his leadership on August 16th, 1848.</p> 

<p>In 1856, this original, very small church was destroyed by the tornado that tore through the Fort Covington, Burke and Chateaugay communities, destroying over 360 buildings in Chateaugay alone. The cyclonic winds and baseball sized hailstones flattened the little Catholic Church on what is now West Main Street. For the next three years, Masses were said in various buildings in the village.</p>

<p>No photos or other depictions of that first church are known to exist. It has only been described as wood-framed and quite small. </p>

<p>Finally, in 1859, construction of a new, larger church was begun on the same site on West Main (the area where the American Legion and a private home now stand). Father Anthony Theves, pastor of St. Joseph's Church in Malone and its missions in Chateaugay and Brushton began the construction of the new building. The citizens of Chateaugay donated everything from money, grain, potatoes, their labor and other items so that construction of the new church could begin. However, it proved to be a slow and frustrating process. Four years later in 1863, only four walls and a roof had been constructed.</p>

<p>That same year, St. Patrick’s Church in Chateaugay was established as an autonomous parish with Father Edmund DePauw as the first resident pastor. He approached the Chateaugay assignment with a dedication and fervor that impressed his parishioners. The congregation grew and his next challenge was the partially constructed second church. When he arrived, he described it as: “little better than a barn, with no pews, badly heated, and so unfinished that the snow found entrance, and the sacred wine froze in the chalice." The church construction was eventually completed with an ornate high altar, pews, steeple with a bell, and all the expected and required décor and statuary. Sheds for horse and buggy rigs sat to the east of the church.</p>

<p><Unfortunately, disaster struck the parish of 2,000 on Wednesday, July 12, 1916. At 9pm, a powerful thunder and lightning storm hit the community. A lightning strike hit the bell tower and the church was burned to the ground within an hour. One legend has it that the only thing saved from the burning building was a statue of the Virgin Mary. Some accounts say other artifacts and items were successfully removed.</p>

<p>The first photos above show three different views of this second Catholic Church. The first is a postcard. The second is a Henry Beach photo and the third is another postcard. Next is a photo of the interior of the old church. The resolution is very poor but one can still get a sense of the interior and the high altar on the back wall. The final photo is a much clearer image of the altar, showing the ornate design.</p>

<p>After being forced to wait for seven years after losing their church to the lightning-caused fire, the St. Patrick’s congregation finally saw the beginning construction of their new home. This would become the present-day St. Patrick’s Church just west of the Four Corners. The inflation which followed WWI had stalled building plans. Masses were held in other larger buildings (a roller skating rink and Sprague’s garage) on West Main while construction was delayed.</p>

<p>On July 8, 1923, the Bishop presided over the laying of the cornerstone for the new building. By the end of the next year, the exterior was largely complete. The first Mass said in the new St. Patrick’s was Midnight Mass on December 24, 1924. Interior finishing then followed. And, according to the <i>Chateaugay Record</i>, Angelo Metallo was part of the interior decorating being done in 1928. The Italian marble altar and fifty-four foot communion rail were installed in 1930. The stained glass windows would follow and the entire interior was eventually completed during the 1930s.</p>

<p>There are six photos above of the completed, present-day building through the years. The first is a view of the Church with the original bell tower. The second shows the Church today with the copper sheathed spire which was installed in 1986. The third and fourth images are of the original white marble high altar, followed by a photo of the altar in 1982 (after the Vatican II renovations were completed) and finishing with a photo of the altar area, or apse, today.</p>

<p>More on Professor Metallo to come…</p>
