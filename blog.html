        <p>I was stopped at the light at the Four Corners this afternoon. I happened to look over at the Hotel while waiting for the light to change.</p>

<p>Many comments have been made on our Facebook page over the years about how it has fallen into ruin.
However, I'm hoping these photos above prompt some memories of the place way "back in the day" and when it was a busy part of downtown.</p>

<p>The first two are shots from 1935. Note the traffic light in the middle of the intersection. The hotel was called the Chateau then. The lobby had floor-to-ceiling windows so those sitting there could watch traffic and passersby and solve the problems of the world.</p>

<p>The next two are from 1944. Notice the tin ceilings in both the bar and the Arabian Room (dining room). Looking out the window of the dining room, the Dairy and the Liquor Store are right across Depot Street.</p>

<p>The last two are from 1949. The dining room photo shows the smaller bar and the bandstand. The glimpse of the wallpaper on the right compliments the dining room's name, "The Arabian Room".</p>

<p>There were more "glory" years to come - the ‘50s, ‘60s, ‘70s, and on... until it closed for good.</p>

        <p>I was recently doing some local research using the issues of the Chateaugay Record from the mid-50s through the mid-60s. After reading through so many newspapers as I took notes, I found myself sitting back and thinking about being a kid during that time. </p>

<p>I think there was no better place for a kid to grow up. I remember so many great times like: sitting on Mose Humiston’s store steps and drinking the big Royal Crown Colas or buying some of his penny candy, Peterson’s and playing pitch in the booths while being yelled at by Evie Franklin for making too much noise and the way the place was always filled to bursting after basketball games, fishing, fishing, and more fishing, the original Jake’s Michigan stand down on West Main, the Skyliner and listening to the “Falcons” and so many other bands, Barnes’ at the Lake (most recently the Lakesider), the Valley Inn, Billy’s Grill, the Gay Bar, the hotel with Patsy Cline blasting on the juke box and all the other bars we were sometimes thrown out of for not having “proof” (and other times not even being checked), Larry Cook and I sitting in Peterson's and drinking Mountain Dew the first day it was ever available here after we had finished work for the day with the "Youth Corps", putting coins on the railroad tracks for the train to flatten as it passed through town, Bernie Mills' diner in the rail car next to the bank,  Paulie Jackson’s Pool Hall, tentatively exploring the Old School which sat cold and empty at the end of Church Street, riding our bikes up to Doug Bova’s store and eating a Sealtest ice cream sandwich while we watched the train go through, the Teen Center, parties at the Dew Drop Inn at the Chasm, camping and building forts up along the Boardman, Quinlan’s with the best meals and pie around, Joe Rovelle running the bowling alley and setting pins there (for a short while), endless baseball games each summer up at the “Old School” after the building was torn down, swimming in “Devil’s Hole”, movies at the theater and Pug McCarthy patrolling the aisles with his flashlight, and so many other great memories.</p>

<p>On Friday and Saturday nights in the ‘50s and early ‘60s, people came to town to do their weekly shopping.  Many would park downtown just to sit in their cars with the windows rolled down and visit with all the folks on the street as they moved from store to store. Those things really cemented the bonds between people and made for a tight-knit little community.</p>

<p>Practically everybody had a nickname, like: Hambone, Gizmo, Mose, Bugsy, Sky, Fish, Cannonball, Pug, Gramp, Red, Tarzan, Doc, Pin, Puddy, Didi, Frenchie, Chief, Twine, and, literally, hundreds of others… Back then communities were much less transient than today. With the Lyon Mountain mines, the milk plant, family farms and all of the local businesses, employment was always available and many generations remained where they were raised and there seemed to be so much more connectedness and strong sense of community. In a town like Chateaugay, which tends to foster strong, heartfelt connections anyway, that sense of belonging and “connectedness” led to longstanding familiarity and the nicknames just followed.	</p>

<p>The way Chateaugay always has and always will connect so deeply with people is proof of how special it is.  This is the ideal hometown…guess that’s why I’m still here.</p>

<p>Chateaugay definitely has changed from the “old days”; lots of vacant buildings, much less activity in the center of the village and new, sometimes more transient, families. But at its core, it still is the same small town that created so many great memories. There are some who live here now that don't know of the memories we carry but there are still many more who do. At its heart, Chateaugay remains pretty special with lots of stories to be remembered, appreciated and told…</p>

        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>My last few weeks have been filled with research about St. Patrick’s Church and its early history. Thank you for the positive comments about my two blog posts. Much of what I used to write the two posts came either from my library and the Society Archives or from the past issues of the Chateaugay Record.</p>

<p>This week, I was asked a question about the beginnings of the present American Legion building on West Main Street. I checked my files and then went to work in the issues of the Chateaugay Record to fill in some gaps in the information I did have (it was built in 1983 and the west addition was completed in 1988 – more on this organization in a future Blog Post or article in the newsletter).</p>

<p>As I was reading through all those newspaper issues, I was reminded for the millionth time how important a hometown paper is to local historians. </p>

<p>The surviving issues of the Chateaugay Journal (1867-1872), the Chateaugay Record (1878-1995), and the second Chateaugay Journal (1896-1909) seem to document everything that happened in Chateaugay and the surrounding area, week after week.</p>

<p>For over one hundred years, Chateaugay’s daily life was reflected in the pages of its newspapers: businesses, birthdays, obituaries, marriages, celebrations, disasters, triumphs – any kind of event, good or bad, appeared in the papers’ pages.</p>

<p>As we research and write our articles, so much information from the pages of the local papers makes its way into the final product. We fully realize the importance of those Chateaugay papers and the role they play in our mission. We use them just about every day. </p>

<p>But, I wondered this week about Chateaugay’s local historians fifty or a hundred years from now. What will they use for research? What will they depend on for a detailed accounting of Chateaugay from 1995 and forward?</p>

<p>Area newspapers routinely publish Chateaugay-related articles, and will continue to do so. However, there is no way that their reporting can approach the detail and completeness of a dedicated staff of local citizens who composed a paper every week filed with all manner of detail about life and the goings-on of our hometown. </p>

<p>We appreciate the area news people who produce those regional newspapers. For example, we clip and file EVERY news article about Chateaugay from the surrounding papers in an attempt to record our present-day local story for those who will follow us. It won’t be anywhere as extensive as the Chateaugay newspapers were able to be up until 1995, but perhaps the clipping files and binders we are assembling will still provide information valuable to local researchers who are working on articles many, many years from now.</p>

<p>We are continually amazed at the breadth and depth of the community history left for us by all of those local newspaper people and we frequently comment about how indebted we are to them and the newspapers they have left behind. </p>

<p>What will future historians say about us and the contemporary history we leave behind for them? </p>

<p>The Chateaugay newspapers we use all the time are that important to local history and research.</p>

<p>Above are images of two of the oldest newspapers in our Archival Collection. They came to us from the McCoy estate.</p>
