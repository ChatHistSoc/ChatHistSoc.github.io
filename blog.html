        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>Just looking through the 2020 US Census data for Chateaugay…</p>

<p>Village population was recorded as 735. That is down from 833 in 2010 (a 12.4% decrease).
The entire Town's population was recorded as 1,743. That is down from 2,155 in 2010 (a 19% drop).
</p>

<p><b>A FEW NOTES:</b></p>

<p>The population decreases since 2010 are not particularly surprising in light of lower resident numbers throughout the entire North Country.</p>

<p>735 residents represents the Village's lowest number of residents since 1880. The village was incorporated in 1868 with an estimated population of 1100. It was at its largest in 1920, when 1291 people lived inside the Village limits.</p>

<p>The 19% drop in the Town's population is deceptive. For the 2010 count, the Correctional Facility in Chateaugay was operating with approximately 250 inmates counted in the 2010 total. The facility, which was opened in 1990 as a drug treatment facility, was closed on July 24, 2014. Therefore, the 2020 count shows the loss of the inmate numbers (which inflates the percentage of the decrease) but also represents an additional, approximate population drop of 160 local residents.</p>

<p>The Town's largest population ever, was in 1850 when 3,728 residents were counted in the Census. That coincided with the opening of the Northern Railroad (later known as the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain RR, and later, as the Rutland RR). The 30 years following the opening of the train route represented Chateaugay's heyday as the economic fallout from the railroad led to a time of increased business activity and rising employment opportunities. At one time, the Chateaugay freight depot was the busiest on the entire line which stretched from Ogdensburg to Rouses Point.</p>

<p>Above are images of the village and surrounding area. The first is from an 1876 map. The second is from Google Earth in 2022.</p>

        <p>Shopping—Some people love it, some people hate it. Whatever the case, shoppers want to know what is available and where to go to purchase it.</p> 

<p>It was no different 130 years ago in Chateaugay. During this week in 1892, local shoppers had a wide range of goods available from a large number of retailers right here in town. </p>

<p>Main Street, from the west end (about where White Street is today) to the east end (up to about where Quinlin’s was-Stewarts is now), was a busy and filled business district. There were shops in all the storefronts, as second floor walk-ups, and even behind the Main Street buildings. Shops extended down River Street, up Depot Street, and down John Street. The alley that used to be between Pearl’s and Alix’s even had a name: Union Avenue-which led to businesses in the back of the East Main Street buildings. </p>

<p>Main Street was not yet paved and had hitching posts placed throughout the entire district as shoppers found plenty of places to tie up their teams as they shopped.</p>

<p>The first two photos give us the flavor of Main Street back at that time. After that, are some of the ads that appeared in the Chateaugay Record during the third week of March 1892. </p>

<p>People could meet all their needs with the wide variety of firms doing business in town. Even all the nationally advertised medications, tinctures and balms were available in the local pharmacies.</p>

        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>Our first newsletter issue of 2022 will be mailed this coming Tuesday. This issue contains articles about: the two airplanes built in Chateaugay during the 60s and 70s, a history of all the businesses in the Jackson/Mitchell block (where Jimmy Mills moved to, on the corner of East Main and Depot) over the years since its construction in 1876, a reminiscence by Royal Nadeau of threshing day in the 40s, and the story of the Smith/Alvord/Cook house (Odie and Barb Cook's stone house) on East Main, from its construction in 1818, to the present.</p>

<p>Lots to read and see (we have again included many, many illustrations and photos throughout the 28 pages). Members, watch your mailboxes!</p>

<p>Also, planning continues for the summer exhibit. It will tell the story of the early years on Chateaugay Lake, from the first settlers through the later 1800s and the construction of the Forge dam, which changed the surface area of the Lakes and the Narrows and helped both the tourist and the iron mining industries thrive.</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight the early settlers, the earliest sporting visitors, the first schoolhouses, methods of transportation - on the lakes as well as to and from them, the seasonal Native American presence, as well as the Native legends of the Lakes, and a full-color, framed, and matted display of the seven A.F. Tait paintings and lithographs set in the Chateaugay Lakes area. Tait produced these works in the mid-1800s, when he was a frequent visitor to the Bellows House (later, the Banner House).</p>

<p>Plan on visiting the Archival Center this summer to take it in! Opening date to be published here soon...</p>

<p>As you can see, we have been (and will continue to be) busy producing content for both members and the general public - all made possible by your continued memberships and support.</p> 

<p>Thank you so much!</p>

<p>Above is an image of the first page from the upcoming issue. Also shown is an illustration a friend sent me. I think it's good for a chuckle or two.</p>

<p>Think spring!!</p>
