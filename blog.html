        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>My last few weeks have been filled with research about St. Patrick’s Church and its early history. Thank you for the positive comments about my two blog posts. Much of what I used to write the two posts came either from my library and the Society Archives or from the past issues of the Chateaugay Record.</p>

<p>This week, I was asked a question about the beginnings of the present American Legion building on West Main Street. I checked my files and then went to work in the issues of the Chateaugay Record to fill in some gaps in the information I did have (it was built in 1983 and the west addition was completed in 1988 – more on this organization in a future Blog Post or article in the newsletter).</p>

<p>As I was reading through all those newspaper issues, I was reminded for the millionth time how important a hometown paper is to local historians. </p>

<p>The surviving issues of the Chateaugay Journal (1867-1872), the Chateaugay Record (1878-1995), and the second Chateaugay Journal (1896-1909) seem to document everything that happened in Chateaugay and the surrounding area, week after week.</p>

<p>For over one hundred years, Chateaugay’s daily life was reflected in the pages of its newspapers: businesses, birthdays, obituaries, marriages, celebrations, disasters, triumphs – any kind of event, good or bad, appeared in the papers’ pages.</p>

<p>As we research and write our articles, so much information from the pages of the local papers makes its way into the final product. We fully realize the importance of those Chateaugay papers and the role they play in our mission. We use them just about every day. </p>

<p>But, I wondered this week about Chateaugay’s local historians fifty or a hundred years from now. What will they use for research? What will they depend on for a detailed accounting of Chateaugay from 1995 and forward?</p>

<p>Area newspapers routinely publish Chateaugay-related articles, and will continue to do so. However, there is no way that their reporting can approach the detail and completeness of a dedicated staff of local citizens who composed a paper every week filed with all manner of detail about life and the goings-on of our hometown. </p>

<p>We appreciate the area news people who produce those regional newspapers. For example, we clip and file EVERY news article about Chateaugay from the surrounding papers in an attempt to record our present-day local story for those who will follow us. It won’t be anywhere as extensive as the Chateaugay newspapers were able to be up until 1995, but perhaps the clipping files and binders we are assembling will still provide information valuable to local researchers who are working on articles many, many years from now.</p>

<p>We are continually amazed at the breadth and depth of the community history left for us by all of those local newspaper people and we frequently comment about how indebted we are to them and the newspapers they have left behind. </p>

<p>What will future historians say about us and the contemporary history we leave behind for them? </p>

<p>The Chateaugay newspapers we use all the time are that important to local history and research.</p>

<p>Above are images of two of the oldest newspapers in our Archival Collection. They came to us from the McCoy estate.</p>

        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>A few weeks ago, I wrote a Blog Post about the three different St. Patrick's churches that were on West Main Street between 1844 and the present. Several people have since reached out and asked me to locate things on a map.</p>

<p>Here goes...I used a Google Earth image of that part of West Main. To orient things, north is to the top of the map. The Four Corners is shown towards the upper right corner of the image.</p>

<p>The yellow box and dot show the earliest locations of the church and rectory. The first church was flattened during the Tornado of 1856 which destroyed or damaged over 300 structures in the Town of Chateaugay. The second Church (on the same site) was shown in the photos that accompanied the Blog Post. It burned to the ground (in less than an hour) as the result of a lightning strike on July 12, 1919.</p>

<p>But, even before the second church was destroyed, the parish was already thinking about building a larger church to accommodate the growing congregation. With that in mind, the parish purchased the land on the corner of Belle Avenue and West Main and the large home just to the west of it in 1911. That location is marked with the blue box and dot. Nothing happened as far as using the newly purchased property to erect a larger church and it sat unused.</p>

<p>However, after the 1916 fire, the church had an opportunity to purchase the land where the church sits today. C.W. Sprague was willing to sell the large lot to St. Patrick's, so the decision was made to sell the unused lot on the corner of Belle Avenue and, eventually, the plot where the first two churches had stood, and build a larger Romanesque church on the much bigger lot which was also closer to the Four Corners.</p>

<p>That's where the church sits today.</p>

<p>All of this information is intended as background to the history of the present church building that is being researched and written by Rosemary Green. This coming July 8th will mark the 100th anniversary of the laying of the cornerstone of the present-day St. Patrick's.</p>

<p>As Rosie is preparing her history of the Church of St. Patrick, I'd like to put out a plea...If anyone has photos showing the church (inside or outside) through the years, please consider loaning them to this project, so they can be scanned. I promise they will be carefully scanned and promptly returned. Contact us via email (chathistsoc@gmail.com) or Facebook PM me (Mick Jarvis) or Rosemary Green if you have any images that you would be willing to share for her project.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The image above shows the three church locations (well actually three churches, but just two building locations and one proposed but unused piece of property)...</p>

        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>I have been researching the water system in the Village of Chateaugay recently and have amassed some interesting facts about the earliest pipes laid throughout the community.</p>

<p>The earliest and most inexpensive water pipes were of wood. Long, straight trees were cut into various lengths (most commonly between six and ten feet long) and were bored through the center with a long steel auger bit. Depending on the size of the bit used, the hole down the length of the log would typically be an inch to an inch and a half in diameter.</p>

<p>This simple method was the most labor efficient. To make joints, one end of a bored log would be sharpened to a tapered end and inserted into the flat end of the log laid before it. The bored hole in the flat-ended log would be enlarged slightly so that when the pointed end was driven in, the diameter of the hole was not constricted and the flow of water impeded.</p> 

<p>This process would be repeated and lines laid under the streets. It was a simple matter of drilling into the line to attach smaller, branch lines which fed homes and businesses.</p>

<p>The tapered joints could be sealed with pine tar or other material, but most often were left “dry” and without sealant since, when the pipes were filled with moving water, the wood fibers would swell and the joint became water tight.</p>

<p>In our area, cedar, pine, hemlock, or even elm were most often used, although any long, straight-grained tree could serve this purpose. These lines could last well over a hundred years without rotting as there were never any appreciable levels of oxygen available to allow rot to take place. The outside of the pipes was surrounded by soil and fill that would soon compact and seal the outer surfaces, and the inside of the pipe was always filled with water.</p>

<p>This is the same circumstance shown on some reality shows on cable tv with present-day loggers harvesting old, downed trees from the beds of large open rivers. In many cases, the trees have been underwater for decades (maybe even centuries), but when brought up and dried, can be sawed up and milled into perfectly good lumber.</p>

<p>Back to wooden water lines—another example of early, wooden pipes is much more labor intensive. This involves “stave” pipes, which were assembled from long chamfered pieces of lumber (think long barrel-like construction) which were bound around the outside with either a coarse wire or flat metal bands. This process was a refinement of the bored log system and was only used if the community laying the lines had the resources and money to pay for the added labor and related expenses involved.</p>

<p>Evidently, one of the advantages of wooden pipes in communities was when fighting fires. If the pipe was readily accessible, it was an easy process to drill into the pipe, insert a hose end and have water available to fight a blaze. To seal the pipe again, it was simply a matter of driving a round plug into the newly-drilled hole in the side of the pipe. Thus, the origin of the term; “fire plug”.</p>

<p>How does this all apply to Chateaugay? To start at the beginning of the process, as they say; the Village was incorporated in 1868. In the earliest days of the community, every home had their own hand-dug well (or cistern or brook, etc.) as a water source and were responsible for their own water supply for daily life.</p> 

<p>Shortly after the incorporation, plans were made for a municipal water system, although the actual water line network would come later. Finally, in 1880, a water line network was begun in the Village by the Chateaugay Waterworks Company, using wooden piping. It appears that the bored pipe method was used in these earliest lines.</p> 

<p>This system worked well for decades but eventually metal pipes began to replace the older, wooden sections of the waterworks—partly to replace sections in need of repair, or to build entirely new lines, but more importantly, to increase water volume to the growing community with larger capacity lines.</p>

<p>Although metal pipes had largely replaced the wooden lines during the early years of the 20th Century, within the last twenty years or so, sections of wooden pipes have even been dug up on Iron Avenue when water line work was being done there. So, there were (or maybe still are) a few short sections of wooden pipe carrying water in the village into the present-day.</p>

<p>In 2018, Tony Green, who was then the maintenance supervisor at the local milk plant, called me up and told me of some wooden pipes unearthed at the end of Collins Street where the plant had some construction underway. He took photos of some of the log lines after they were pulled from the ground and then sawed sections that showed the bored water line and a tapered end that was used in a pipe joint. He turned the sawed examples over to the Historical Society.</p>

<p>Eight photos are featured above: three that Tony took, two images of the sawed sections in our Archival Center, followed by three Google Images that show a stave pipe with the outer wrappings, a good view of wooden pipes jointed with a tapered, pointed joint, and a photo showing how the logs would be bored with a long metal bit.</p> 

<p>So, the first five images are of local, Chateaugay Village wooden pipes and the last three are stock images from the internet showing pipe details.</p>

<p>On a personal note, my Dad was a plumber at the mines in Lyon Mountain as a young man. As a youngster, I often helped him when he did plumbing for others or at our home. I remember having to help thread pipes, coating the new threads with pipe dope to help seal them, and tighten the fittings using pipe wrenches, or helping to seal the bell joints in Orangeburg sewer pipes by pounding oakum into the joint and sealing it with melted lead. All very labor intensive, for sure.</p>

<p>When thinking about plumbing and how it has progressed from lead and iron pipes, copper, plastic, and now ultra-modern systems like Sharkbite and Pex; it is interesting to see how the plumbing trade certainly has undergone amazing changes in materials, techniques, and processes.</p>

<p>And to think that the local materials used to run the earliest water pipes in the village were just the trees growing here…</p>
