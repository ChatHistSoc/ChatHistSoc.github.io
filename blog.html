        <p>This photo was taken in the spring of 1912. The view is looking eastward on East Main Street. The Town Hall is just one year old and later in the summer of 1912, Main Street will be paved. Note the tall elm trees that lined the street. The man and his team on the left are coming out of John Street. The Kissane block that stood (part of it still stands) between John Street and the Town Hall had not been rebuilt yet, following a fire that destroyed it. And, not a "motorcar" in sight (as they would have said back then).</p>

        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>A week ago today, I posted a very blurry photo on Facebook of the apartment building that once sat on the lot just west of the current Sunoco station, which is on the corner of Belle Avenue and West Main.</p>

<p>Thank you for all the responses. Your comments added much to the most recent history of the building.</p>

<p>A special thanks to Silas Martin for posting a very clear photo of the exterior of the house and a few photos showing some of the woodwork details of the inside, in that discussion thread.</p>

<p>Now, using Silas’ exterior photo as a starting point, here is a brief follow-up to last weeks’ post. </p>

<p>As I have mentioned before, Rosemary Green is currently researching the history of the present St. Patrick’s Church. This July will mark the 100th anniversary of the laying of the church’s cornerstone. To commemorate that milestone, her history will celebrate how the church came to be and how the construction process unfolded. </p>

<p>Posts like this help by adding more information to her research. So many of you have shared memories and information and a sincere thank you for that. Keep the responses coming [on Facebook or send an email to chathistsoc@gmail.com]!</p>

<p>Now back to that piece of property and the buildings on it… That lot was the site of the first rectory of St. Patrick’s Parish. Father Edmund DePauw, the church’s first pastor from 1863 until 1889, lived in that small structure, which was just a few steps from the Church of St. Patrick (located just to the west of the present-day American Legion building). </p>

<p>That first building on the property was quite small and served as Fr. DePauw’s home during the earliest years of the parish. Unfortunately, no photo of that first rectory is known to exist.</p>

<p>Then, in 1889, Father Peter J. Devlin succeeded, Fr. (by then Monsignor) Edmund DePauw, as the pastor of St. Patrick’s Church. Father DePauw had chosen to retire and return to his native Belgium after more than twenty-five years in Chateaugay.</p>

<p>The local Catholic community was growing rapidly in the late 1880s. Fr. DePauw had already floated the idea of a new, larger church to accommodate the growing congregation. Fr. Devlin saw the parish as active and vital, as Fr. DePauw had. </p>

<p>In addition to the conversation of a possible new church, Devlin also felt a larger rectory was needed. He foresaw the future arrival of assistant pastors as the parish’s needs increased and knew the original rectory would be very inadequate to house (and administrate) the growing parish. He had the smaller, original rectory moved from the lot and built the larger rectory shown here.</p>

<p>Silas’ photo is a clear image of that Rectory constructed by Father Peter Devlin in 1890 in the years before its demolition a few years ago.</p>

<p>In 1930, the new St. Patrick’s was nearing its interior completion and the parish pastor at that time, Father James McClure, had moved into the rectory adjacent to the newly constructed church. </p>

<p>The rectory built by Fr. Devlin was sold to Floyd English who renovated the structure into an apartment building, which it remained until it sat unoccupied in the years leading up to its demolition in 2018.</p>

<p>Be sure to watch for Rosie's St. Patrick’s Church history early this summer!</p>

        <p>I was stopped at the light at the Four Corners this afternoon. I happened to look over at the Hotel while waiting for the light to change.</p>

<p>Many comments have been made on our Facebook page over the years about how it has fallen into ruin.
However, I'm hoping these photos above prompt some memories of the place way "back in the day" and when it was a busy part of downtown.</p>

<p>The first two are shots from 1935. Note the traffic light in the middle of the intersection. The hotel was called the Chateau then. The lobby had floor-to-ceiling windows so those sitting there could watch traffic and passersby and solve the problems of the world.</p>

<p>The next two are from 1944. Notice the tin ceilings in both the bar and the Arabian Room (dining room). Looking out the window of the dining room, the Dairy and the Liquor Store are right across Depot Street.</p>

<p>The last two are from 1949. The dining room photo shows the smaller bar and the bandstand. The glimpse of the wallpaper on the right compliments the dining room's name, "The Arabian Room".</p>

<p>There were more "glory" years to come - the ‘50s, ‘60s, ‘70s, and on... until it closed for good.</p>
