        <p>Shopping—Some people love it, some people hate it. Whatever the case, shoppers want to know what is available and where to go to purchase it.</p> 

<p>It was no different 130 years ago in Chateaugay. During this week in 1892, local shoppers had a wide range of goods available from a large number of retailers right here in town. </p>

<p>Main Street, from the west end (about where White Street is today) to the east end (up to about where Quinlin’s was-Stewarts is now), was a busy and filled business district. There were shops in all the storefronts, as second floor walk-ups, and even behind the Main Street buildings. Shops extended down River Street, up Depot Street, and down John Street. The alley that used to be between Pearl’s and Alix’s even had a name: Union Avenue-which led to businesses in the back of the East Main Street buildings. </p>

<p>Main Street was not yet paved and had hitching posts placed throughout the entire district as shoppers found plenty of places to tie up their teams as they shopped.</p>

<p>The first two photos give us the flavor of Main Street back at that time. After that, are some of the ads that appeared in the Chateaugay Record during the third week of March 1892. </p>

<p>People could meet all their needs with the wide variety of firms doing business in town. Even all the nationally advertised medications, tinctures and balms were available in the local pharmacies.</p>

        <p>Our first newsletter issue of 2022 will be mailed this coming Tuesday. This issue contains articles about: the two airplanes built in Chateaugay during the 60s and 70s, a history of all the businesses in the Jackson/Mitchell block (where Jimmy Mills moved to, on the corner of East Main and Depot) over the years since its construction in 1876, a reminiscence by Royal Nadeau of threshing day in the 40s, and the story of the Smith/Alvord/Cook house (Odie and Barb Cook's stone house) on East Main, from its construction in 1818, to the present.</p>

<p>Lots to read and see (we have again included many, many illustrations and photos throughout the 28 pages). Members, watch your mailboxes!</p>

<p>Also, planning continues for the summer exhibit. It will tell the story of the early years on Chateaugay Lake, from the first settlers through the later 1800s and the construction of the Forge dam, which changed the surface area of the Lakes and the Narrows and helped both the tourist and the iron mining industries thrive.</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight the early settlers, the earliest sporting visitors, the first schoolhouses, methods of transportation - on the lakes as well as to and from them, the seasonal Native American presence, as well as the Native legends of the Lakes, and a full-color, framed, and matted display of the seven A.F. Tait paintings and lithographs set in the Chateaugay Lakes area. Tait produced these works in the mid-1800s, when he was a frequent visitor to the Bellows House (later, the Banner House).</p>

<p>Plan on visiting the Archival Center this summer to take it in! Opening date to be published here soon...</p>

<p>As you can see, we have been (and will continue to be) busy producing content for both members and the general public - all made possible by your continued memberships and support.</p> 

<p>Thank you so much!</p>

<p>Above is an image of the first page from the upcoming issue. Also shown is an illustration a friend sent me. I think it's good for a chuckle or two.</p>

<p>Think spring!!</p>

        <p>At first glance, the photos above don’t seem to be Chateaugay history-related. But, they are actually a part of the two major projects we are working on right now.</p> 

<p>First, is our newsletter preparation; which is an on-going process. We are editing our next issue, which will be mailed to members next month. We think you will enjoy the upcoming articles – everything from airplane building in Chateaugay, to an historic home in the village, to a very notable business block on East Main and also a memory of farming in the 1940s.</p>

<p>Our second project is our upcoming summer exhibit. The research and development necessary for the display has begun in earnest. It will open on June 29th and will be available for viewing all summer. It will examine the Early Years of the History of Chateaugay Lake. Among our exhibit display topics will be: </p>

<li>The earliest settlement and settlers</li>
<li>Transportation and its development as people and commerce came and went from the early Lakes</li>
<li>The building of the Forge Dam and the effects of raising the water levels of the Lakes and the Narrows</li>
<li>The Native American seasonal presence on the Lake and the various legends that have been told about their time in the area</li> 
<li>A look at the earliest country schools in the area around the Lakes</li>
<li>A framed display of the works of artist, Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait. He visited the Bellows Lake House (later known as the Banner House) for several years during the mid-1800s. We have seven of his works that we believe were set in the area around Chateaugay Lake. </li>

<br />

<p>As the photos show, the framing of the Tait prints is well under way. The specific image included above (3/3) is probably the one we are all most familiar with. This ice fishing scene will be available at the exhibit, not in the version shown here, but as a large vintage print, mounted in a wonderful, ornate antique frame. The other six Tait scenes will all be newly matted and framed and will show his works both as original oil paintings and as lithographs produced by Currier and Ives. Each view will be complimented with a text panel, explaining the history and details of each work.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to readying the newsletter for our members. We think we have another interesting and well-illustrated issue. The summer exhibit promises to be both information filled and eye catching. We hope you enjoy them both.</p>

<p>Our group may be small, but we try to remain busy and working to present more of the history of Chateaugay and area each year. </p>

<p>Thanks for your continued support.</p>
