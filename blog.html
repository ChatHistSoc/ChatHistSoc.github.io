        <p>80 years ago, on December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japanese planes.</p>

<p>To mark this anniversary, Mrs. Shannon McArdle and the Advanced English class at CCS have designed and placed an exhibit in the windows of the Library at the school.</p>

<p>This annual commemoration was begun three years ago thanks to the sponsorship of Joseph Ryan, former Chateaugay resident and son of Pearl Harbor survivor, Joseph J. Ryan. The Historical Society is proud to collaborate with the students and staff in producing this exhibit each fall.</p>

<p>If you are attending any events at the school during December, be sure to stop by the library and take in the display.</p>

        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>This post is about the American Revolution but has a peripheral connection to Chateaugay. </p.

<p>I have just finished rereading a book about Henry Knox entitled: General Henry Knox -  Visionary General of the American Revolution by Mark Puls. </p>

<p>Knox was a clerk in a Boston bookstore as a young man and developed an avid interest in military affairs. He read extensively and became very knowledgeable about artillery and its role in effective warfare. He eventually served in the colonial army and rose to the rank of general, having impressed General Washington with his mastery of military science.</p>

<p>The Chateaugay connection to all this:</p>

<p>On May 10, 1775, American troops commanded by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, had captured Fort Ticonderoga from the English. Their guide was Nathan Beman, a young man from Shoreham, Vermont, just across Lake Champlain. Beman had spent much time at the fort, wandering through the grounds and visiting with the small contingent of British troops stationed there. Because of this familiarity with the grounds and the fort, his father, Samuel Beman, offered Nathan’s services to the colonial troops who were using the Beman tavern as a meeting place to plan the takeover of the fort.</p>

<p>Nathan Beman would eventually become one of Chateaugay’s founders (along with his brother-in-law, Benjamin Roberts) in 1796. </p>

<p>Beman described the takeover of Ticonderoga in a letter he sent to the Malone Palladium newspaper in May of 1835.</p>

<p>Now, back to General Knox: </p>

<p>Following the capture of the fort, Knox was tasked by General Washington with transporting the fifty-nine pieces of artillery from Ticonderoga to the highlands overlooking Boston. The British occupied the city and Washington believed if the cannon should be installed on Dorchester heights overlooking the city, the British would be forced to retreat.</p>

<p>Knox directed his small contingent of men to dissemble the cannon and transport them over 300 miles to Boston. Using eighty teams of oxen and sleds, the men struggled with brutal cold and snow but made it to Boston over the next several weeks. The pieces were reassembled, positioned on the heights and the English departed the city. Knox’s “Noble Train of Artillery” had succeeded in its task.</p>

<p>If you have an interest in Revolutionary War history, this book is an interesting and entertaining read. It illustrates both the extent of the American determination and George Washington’s skill at recognizing the abilities of the men in his command and utilizing those skills to the patriot advantage.</p>

<p>This represents a Chateaugay-related story in the sense that one of our founders, Nathan Beman, played a very small role when the artillery was secured as Fort Ticonderoga was retaken by the Americans. This made the big pieces of armament available to drive the British from Boston early in the Revolution.</p>

<p>The images shown here are:</p>

<li>Puls’ book cover </li>

<li>Alonzo Chappel’s 1856 painting of the takeover of Fort Ticonderoga showing Ethan Allen demanding the surrender with Nathan Beman depicted beside him.</li>

<li>Nathan Beman cropped from the Chappel painting.</li>

<li>A scene showing the American troops struggling with the eighty tons of artillery as they made the 300 mile journey from Ticonderoga, to Lake George and overland to Dorchester Heights. This is a Google image of a painting completed in 1946 by Tom Lovell entitled: “Noble Train of Artillery.” </li>

        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>Have you ever seen postcards labelled “Greetings From Chateaugay, New York” that don’t really represent a local scene, like the ones shown here? If you have, then you were most likely looking at what is known as a “Linen” postcard.</p>

<p>A German immigrant named Curt Teich (pronounced “tike”) developed a new type of postcard in the early 1930s. It had a very high cotton content which resulted in the linen-like look to the postcard paper. In addition, Teich invented a new coloring technique which allowed for vibrant tones and hues which made the cards particularly eye catching, like mini color paintings.</p>

<p>These cards were produced from the 1930s into the 1950s. They typically had a tagline on the border that read “Greetings From Chateaugay” (or any other specific location). Because automobile use and the idea of travelling for vacations were both growing rapidly, most of the scenes were landscapes, of a sort, shown in vivid colors and portraying sweeping, scenic vistas.</p>

<p>The majority of the scenes were actually made by combining specific features from several original images. In effect, they were collages of roadways, mountains, water, trees and plants that made up a scene that did not (nor was it intended to) represent the specific place mentioned in the tagline.</p>

<p>The main appeal of the linen postcards was the vibrant, and often surreal, palette of colors. This was a great contrast to the Depression era postcards of black and white images.</p>

<p>Linen postcards began to be replaced with actual photographs in the 1950s. This coincided with the growth of the Kodak company. In fact, the earliest true photo postcards are sometimes referred to as “Kodachrome” postcards.</p>

<p>Five of the views shown here are linen postcards. The sixth is image is of an early photographic postcard which contained a tagline like its linen predecessors had displayed. Incidentally, this photo postcard is also a collage-type image and the photos used are not specific to the community named in the tagline.</p>

<p>So, if you run across any postcards like these, you are looking at a vivid, stylized scene that only shares the name in the tagline with our hometown. The scene depicted (whether real or constructed of several unrelated parts) is not to be found anywhere in what we know as Chateaugay.</p>
