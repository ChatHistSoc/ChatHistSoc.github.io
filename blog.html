        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>We have begun working on our next quarterly newsletter. We will have four articles in this issue:</p> 

<p><b>First,</b> we will tell the story of “Chateaugay” winning the Kentucky Derby in 1963 and how the horse came to be named after our town. </p>

<p><b>Second </b>will be about the life and times of Evelyn Nesbit Thaw, perhaps America’s first “supermodel”. She was a summer resident of Chateaugay Lake for a few years in the beginning of the last century. She always created a bit of a stir when she was here. She also made silent movies at the Lake when she was in residence at “Camp Jack” on the Upper Lake.</p>

<p><b>Third </b>will be the 1931 story of a 41 year old pitcher for the Chateaugay Ponies who pitched two complete game shutouts in 48 hours over the Fourth of July weekend and then played the outfield and went 3 for 5 just two days later. Talk about an “Iron Man” performance…</p>

<p><b>Fourth </b>will be the beginning of a series in which we will recognize the contributions of local veterans who served our country. Leading off this series will be the story of Walt Ouimet who served in WWII and again during the Korean War. He was a prisoner of war for 29 months during the Korean Conflict.</p>

<p>There is much to read on a variety of topics in this upcoming issue. The Publications Committee has begun editing the articles. We hope to go to print in the next two weeks. Stay tuned as we progress.</p>

<h3>OUR OTHER NEWS:</h3>
<p>We will be reopening to the public for our regular schedule beginning on Wednesday, July 7. We will be open every Wednesday and Saturday morning from 9am until noon, starting July 7 through Wednesday, September 29.</p>

<p>July 7 will also mark the opening of our first major exhibit in over 18 months. We are currently assembling the materials and objects for <b>“The History of Photography in Chateaugay.” </b>We have identified 25 photographers who have been associated with Chateaugay from the 1850s through 2021. We will have information about the photographers themselves, examples of their work, which will include many images of how Chateaugay has been portrayed over the years. Also, part of the exhibit will have examples of various photographic equipment and examples of different types of photographs.</p>

<p>In addition, our newly rearranged public research area will be open anyone wishing to do local history or genealogical research. Our public computers have been set up with website links and data files to aid any researcher. Also, our shelves of public materials have been updated and rearranged for easy and efficient use.</p>

<p>We have remained very busy during the COVID shutdown and we will be using the remaining weeks before July 7 to finish the photography exhibit, publish the newsletter and get the Archival Center ready for your visits and research. </p>

<p>Please stop by and see all that we have to offer beginning on July 7. And, as always, thank you for the tremendous support you have given us over the years.</p>

        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>The railroad marked the beginning of a period of growth and prosperity for our hometown. The arrival of the railroad saw the population of Chateaugay at its largest. The US Census in 1850 counted 3,721 people living here, the most ever.</p>

<p>Chateaugay’s farmers took advantage of the newly available markets and increased their livestock and crop production, eventually shipping hundreds of cars of cattle, horses, potatoes, etc. from the local depot. Local manufacturers also benefitted as the tonnage of excelsior, wood pulp, lumber, starch and many other locally produced goods grew to unimagined volume. In the late 1800s, Chateaugay was the busiest shipping station on the entire rail line.</p>

<p>Passenger service was another major benefit of the train’s establishment. The newspapers were filled with mentions of people using the train to travel in the area as well as to begin longer journeys. For example, many from Chateaugay went to Leadville, Colorado during the silver boom and others chose to move into the upper Midwest, particularly Michigan, to become involved in the rapidly growing lumber businesses there. All of these Chateaugay citizens on their way west, began their trip at the local passenger depot.</p>

<p>The original Northern Railroad underwent many reorganizations, sales and resales between 1850 and its demise. Names were changes and ownership changed but most are familiar with its longest used name; the Rutland Railroad.</p>

<p>Eventually, competition from new and faster methods of shipping goods led to the railroad’s inability to maintain a profit with the northern New York line. On June 5, 1965 the last train rolled through Chateaugay and the railroad era came to a local end.</p>

<p><h3>Chateaugay Record - June 9, 1967</h3></p>

<p>The following column appeared in the Chateaugay Record on June 9, 1967. It captures what the railroad meant to Chateaugay and the change about to happen with its closure.</p>

<p><b><i>Last Train Passes Through</b></i></p>

<p><i>One hundred and fifteen [seventeen] years of railroading in Chateaugay, almost to the day, took place last Friday as the last locomotive to pass through town neared the crossing on Depot St. Only a few people were present to watch the last train pull thought at about midday to pass into history and to end an era of railroading in this section of Northern New York.</i></p>

<p><i>The quiet exit of the last train was a far cry from that eventful day, June 1, 1850, when nearly every person in town was present to hail the arrival of the first passenger train into Chateaugay.</i></p>

<p><i>Hundreds of enthusiastic citizens lined the tracks to welcome the train pulled by a steam locomotive bearing the Town’s name. Remembering that the event was the culmination of twenty years of striving, anxiety and sacrifice, the townspeople looked forward to the prosperity and growth that the new railroad would bring.
Indeed, their vision was not far wrong. By the late 1800s the town was booming, with local factories and farmers alike reaping the benefit of the newly opened markets on the east coast.</i></p>

<p><i>Eventually competition in the form of better highways, mass produced autos and trucks, made itself felt and business and profits of the Rutland Railroad steadily declined.</i></p>

<p><i>Although efforts were made in the post-World War II days to recapture some of the freight business, the railroad eventually realized it was a losing battle and with the event of a strike by employees a few years ago, ceased operations completely.</i></p>

<p><i>Now the trains and indeed even the rails are gone and soon all traces of railroading will be erased from the local scene – with only the memory of the mournful train whistle sounding in the early morning hours remaining of what was once the pride and joy of the North Country.</i></p>

<p>The timeline below sets the details and dates of Chateaugay’s railroad experience. The included images are of the trains and the depot from across the years.</p>

        <p>I think this poem should be the official tribute to Jake's Red Hots. These twelve stanzas capture the Jake’s experience perfectly. This “Ode to Jake’s” along with the many warm memories of that little stand that everyone has shared on Facebook, will insure that Jake's forever remains a treasured and significant memory of Chateaugay's history. </p>

<p>I am going to make it a part of the Historical Society's archival collection.</p>
