        <p>I have been doing some follow-up research on the article I wrote on the three excelsior mills that were in town at the turn of the last century. The original article appeared in Vol. XII, Issue 3 of our newsletter in 2018. This post is not meant to be a comprehensive recap of the excelsior article but rather, additional material to supplement the original information.</p>

<p>Excelsior is a little-known product today. Around the turn of the last century, it was a valuable commercial commodity.</p> 

<p>The newly designed maps above will show where each of the mills was located in the vicinity of the railyard as it crossed Depot Street and paralleled Monroe Street.</p>

<p>Any evidence of these mills is now long-gone but "back in the day", they represented sources of jobs and vital commercial income for Chateaugay.</p>

<p>I remember an anthropology/archeology professor at SUNY Potsdam telling us that one of the main challenges that historians and researchers face is the way that modern man can alter the landscape and make it unrecognizable from its appearance in the past. I remember his quote: “You have to be ready to deal with modern man’s ability to move vast amounts of dirt!”</p>

<p>In this case, we have to consider modern construction abilities as well and how the landscape of what was then the railyard and all its sidings, main tracks and buildings has changed over the years. The buildings parallel to Monroe Street that stand today are vastly different than those of 100 years ago.</p>

<p>The first map shows the locations of the three mills on a set of 1912 insurance company maps. The second view is from a Google Earth image from 2022 with the mill locations superimposed over it.</p>

<p>If you missed the newsletter this article appeared in, you can learn about Chateaugay’s excelsior industry. We have back issues of Vol. XII, Issue 3 (2018) available for purchase at the Archival Center.</p>

        <p>We learned that Mr. William Cullen passed away on May 21. He taught English at CCS from 1947 through 1964. He will be remembered by his Chateaugay students from those years as an excellent teacher and exemplary man. </p>
<p>Rest in peace, sir.</p>

      <h2>Population Changes in Chateaugay</h2>

        <p>Just looking through the 2020 US Census data for Chateaugay…</p>

<p>Village population was recorded as 735. That is down from 833 in 2010 (a 12.4% decrease).
The entire Town's population was recorded as 1,743. That is down from 2,155 in 2010 (a 19% drop).
</p>

<p><b>A FEW NOTES:</b></p>

<p>The population decreases since 2010 are not particularly surprising in light of lower resident numbers throughout the entire North Country.</p>

<p>735 residents represents the Village's lowest number of residents since 1880. The village was incorporated in 1868 with an estimated population of 1100. It was at its largest in 1920, when 1291 people lived inside the Village limits.</p>

<p>The 19% drop in the Town's population is deceptive. For the 2010 count, the Correctional Facility in Chateaugay was operating with approximately 250 inmates counted in the 2010 total. The facility, which was opened in 1990 as a drug treatment facility, was closed on July 24, 2014. Therefore, the 2020 count shows the loss of the inmate numbers (which inflates the percentage of the decrease) but also represents an additional, approximate population drop of 160 local residents.</p>

<p>The Town's largest population ever, was in 1850 when 3,728 residents were counted in the Census. That coincided with the opening of the Northern Railroad (later known as the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain RR, and later, as the Rutland RR). The 30 years following the opening of the train route represented Chateaugay's heyday as the economic fallout from the railroad led to a time of increased business activity and rising employment opportunities. At one time, the Chateaugay freight depot was the busiest on the entire line which stretched from Ogdensburg to Rouses Point.</p>

<p>Above are images of the village and surrounding area. The first is from an 1876 map. The second is from Google Earth in 2022.</p>
