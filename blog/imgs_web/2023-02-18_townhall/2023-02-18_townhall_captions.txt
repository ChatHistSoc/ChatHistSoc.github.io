Looking eastward on East Main Street in the spring of 1912. The newly finished Town Hall is the columned building on the left.
A cropped close-up of the building and the team coming off John Street.
Notice the tall backstage area in the Opera House; this higher section allowed for more elaborate stage shows as entire backdrops could be lowered (or raised out of the way) to accommodate different scenes or acts of larger productions.
This photo is dated 1939. Note the elm that had been planted in front. It was rising straight and tall to shade part of the building’s front. On the right is a glimpse of the corner of Quinlan’s Restaurant. 
A view of the front as the building would look if you stood on the sidewalk in 1939. 
Another photo from before the 1940 fire. This one is especially clear and reveals much detail in the exterior features.
The building fully involved in the blaze that destroyed the interior and the entrance on November 16, 1940.
As the smoke cleared (literally) the next morning, this was the scene that greeted townspeople who came to see the damage. 
The sign in front says “Keep off the Grass” and not “Keep out of the Burned Area”, so there were some who ventured closer.
A view of the inside which shows that nothing remained of the interior framing. 
The building today. Gone is the tall scenery space in the theater, and the present entrance mirrors the original façade on a smaller scale.
