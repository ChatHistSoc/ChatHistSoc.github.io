This colorized photo (an excellent recoloring by Scott Durant of Malone, by the way) shows the Red Bridge and the Globe Grist Mill looking north towards where the present bridge is.
View under the bridge, again looking north, and the grist mill in Douglass Hollow comes into view.
A Google Earth view showing the location of our covered bridge in relation to the present-day bridge and the railroad.
