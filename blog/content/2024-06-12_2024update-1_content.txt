<p>SOME CHATEAUGAY HISTORICAL SOCIETY NEWS – </p>

<p>Our Summer 2024 exhibit, entitled “A Walk Down Main Street in the 1950s and ‘60s”, is open every Wednesday and Saturday from 9am until noon through Saturday, September 28. It is on display in our Archival Center on the second floor of the Town Hall. Stop in and check it out.</p>

<p>Issue #2 of our quarterly newsletter has been mailed. Members, watch your mailboxes for your 28-page copy to arrive (if it hasn’t already).</p>

<p>Also, as many you may know, we have been working for quite some time on a plan to erect an information kiosk on the Chasm Road to acknowledge the homestead of Nathan Beman, one of Chateaugay’s founders. The covered kiosk will be handicap accessible and will feature several information boards that will tell the story of Beman and his family. The information panels will be fully illustrated with color images and explanatory text.</p>

<p>The Franklin County Highway Department has recently installed two culverts. Local contractor, Ronnie Jarvis, is currently working on the kiosk structure. The timber frame is up and the forms for the concrete slab and handicapped ramp are in place. So, work on the kiosk is going very well. After the concrete pour, the four-slope roof will be framed and finished.</p>

<p>Now, with our newsletter and exhibit both completed, we will be turning our attention to the information for the panels in the kiosk. Our plan is to consult with a graphic designer to help with the panel layout. We will keep you updated as things progress. This will be a slower process. Design takes time as does the actual production of the weatherproof information panels for the kiosk.</p>

<p>This Beman Homestead kiosk is just one part of a larger project we are developing. We already have 15 historical markers in place throughout the township. We have ordered additional, new historical markers to be placed at other notable sites around the Town and Village of Chateaugay. Some of the new markers will have accompanying information panels as well. </p>

<p>Once the Beman kiosk is complete and all the additional markers and other information panels have arrived and been installed, we plan on writing a booklet that will have even more information for each of the marker sites. The kiosk/historical marker booklet will also contain maps and illustrations for each location. </p>

<p>We are hoping to have the booklet available in printed form as well as a version which could be downloaded to a phone. That way, folks will be able to take the booklet (either paper or electronic) and do a self-guided driving or walking tour (in the case of the markers in the village) of over two dozen notable local sites.</p>

<p>As you can see, we have lots going on. We surely seem to keep busy! Thank you to everyone for your continued and avid support for our group and its projects.</p>
