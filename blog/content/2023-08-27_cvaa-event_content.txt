<p>I am finishing an article for our Society Newsletter on the J.C. Cook General Store that once straddled the border in Earlville. The store building was later moved about a mile, to the Rennie farm in Rockburn, Quebec.</p>

<p>Mr. Rennie made the store one of the buildings in his “living museum” on the First Concession.</p>

<p>The Rennie property is now the site of an annual Antiques Show hosted by the Chateauguay Valley Antique Association. Since its beginnings following the death of Mr. Rennie, the antique show has grown to include a flea market complete with craftspeople, a classic car show, antique farm implements, many, many food vendors, and all of Mr. Rennie’s collection of buildings (a school, a church, Mr. Cook’s general store and more) and their displays of historic objects.</p>

<p>The annual show was this weekend (Aug. 26 and 27), so I paid it two visits. I wanted to take photos and finish off a few details for my article. Mission accomplished! Had a great time (both times)!</p>

<p>Watch for this event next August! It is an interesting and enjoyable way to spend a summer day!</p>

<p>Also, the complete story of the J.C. Cook General Store will be in the upcoming issue of the Chateaugay Historical Society’s newsletter, complete with some interesting historical photos.</p>

<p>Members, start watching your mailboxes for this issue beginning around the middle of September.</p>

<p>Here are some of the photos I took this weekend at the CVAA show…</p>
