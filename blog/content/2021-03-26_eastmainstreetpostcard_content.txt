<p>Here is one of my favorite images showing the south side of East Main Street. This side of East Main was never photographed as much as the north side but the buildings were equally as impressive.</p> 

<p>This postcard is undated but is probably from the late 1920s.  It clearly shows the extent of the buildings on this side of the street back then. </p>

<p>The only two of these buildings still standing. First, is the one on the corner, in the immediate right of the scene. This is the Jackson Block which was constructed in 1876. Among the more recent businesses in this two-storefront structure have been (in no particular order): Mills Diner, Ethel's Harvest Room, Bush's Restaurant, Chic-Toggs, Write One, and Hometown Family Chiropractic. It is vacant today. </p>

<p>The only other surviving building is the three story one, midway down the street. This has been the home of Shaw's 5&10, Alix's Variety Store, and Lopardo's Barber Shop. Today it is Write One Plus.</p>

<p>If the postcard was enlarged, one can see the stained glass transom panels in each masonry building just like the ones that were in the north side buildings.</p>

<p>The two wooden frame buildings sandwiched between the two surviving buildings were demolished to create the grass lot that is there today.</p>

<p>The first portions of the building immediately to the east of the three story structure were where Cantwell's Hall was located on the second floor. The ground floor would eventually become Pearl's (which is a subject of one of the articles in the soon-to-be published Chateaugay Historical Society quarterly newsletter) which was the "go to" downtown store for clothing and footwear for the whole family for many years.</p>

<p>The lumberyard which sits across from the Town Hall (and is the subject of another article in that upcoming issue) is obscured by the trees.</p>

<p>For a small town, Chateaugay certainly had an impressive business district "back in the day."</p>
