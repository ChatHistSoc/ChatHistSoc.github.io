<b>PRESS RELEASE</b>
<p>The Chateaugay Historical Society is busily involved in the planning and development of our Summer 2025 activities. We will be honoring our community’s founders: Nathan Beman and Benjamin Roberts.</p>

<p>Both first came here in the summer of 1795 when they were part of a survey party that was tasked with laying out the Great Lots of what would soon become known as “Four Corners” or Chateaugay. They were so impressed with the wilderness here that they both returned the next year with their families and became the first settlers in Chateaugay. </p>

<p>Our events will begin on Saturday May 10, 2025, when an opening ceremony will be held at the newly completed information kiosk at the Nathan Beman Homestead Site on the Chasm Road, approximately .2 miles from Route 11.</p>

<p>At 10:00 that morning, a short dedication and ribbon cutting ceremony will open this significant location from Chateaugay’s earliest history. The events will be less than 30 minutes long. No seating or restrooms will be provided. Attendees are welcome to bring a chair if desired.</p>

<p>The formal ribbon-cutting and opening of the Beman kiosk will be followed by a light reception in the Public Meeting Room on the second floor of the Chateaugay Town Hall at 191 East Main Street. Coffee, other drinks and pastries will be provided.</p>

<p>Adjacent to the reception in the Meeting Room, the Society’s Archival Center will be open as we debut our Summer 2025 exhibit: “Nathan Beman and Benjamin Roberts: The Founders of Chateaugay”.</p>

<p>In addition to the kiosk and exhibit openings that day, we will also be unveiling our other major project: A Heritage Trail in Chateaugay. 
The Society will have placed thirty historic markers throughout the town and village at that point. In addition, we have identified another twenty-one buildings and sites of historic significance and will also be marking all twelve cemeteries and burial grounds throughout the Town of Chateaugay.
On May 10, we will have our newest publication available. It is a 100+ page full-color book of 60+ significant sites in Chateaugay. This guide to our local Heritage Trail will be complete with maps, photos and illustrations. It will also provide more in-depth details and some history for each location.
In addition to the printed booklet, the Heritage Trail information will also be available via a QR code (found on any of the historic markers) which will allow phone and tablet users to utilize an online version of the booklet.</p>

<p>Using either the printed or electronic versions, anyone interested will be able to do a self-guided driving tour of all 60+ sites within our town. </p>

<p>Also, if you prefer to walk, the markers and sites within the village lend themselves to an enjoyable walking tour of those thirty-one locations. The thirty-two sites outside the village limits would still await the driving portion of your Heritage Trail experience.</p>

<p>May 10, 2025, will be an eventful day for Chateaugay as we celebrate even more of its unique and colorful history.</p>

<p>If you are able to, please join us for any or all the events on that day: the kiosk dedication, the reception, the exhibit opening, or exploring our local Heritage Trail.</p>
