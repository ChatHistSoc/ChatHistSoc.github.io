<p>With a bit of snow forecast for the middle of the week, I thought we would look a little farther into winter. This photo was brought into the Archival Center by Edith Lopardo.</p>

<p>It is undated but was taken at the rink on River Street before the new school was built.</p>

<p>Note how the ladies are clad in dress coats and hats as they watch the skaters.</p>
