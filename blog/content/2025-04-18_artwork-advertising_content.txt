<p>FREQUENTLY MISSED OR LARGELY UNKNOWN EXAMPLES OF “ARTWORK” AND ADVERTISING IN CHATEAUGAY FROM OVER THE YEARS</p>

<p>I was thinking about a certain group of images as I worked in the Chateaugay Historical Society’s photo collection just recently. There have been some scenes that were viewed by the public which were often presented on a larger and very dramatic and visual scale. Others were quite small and mostly never seen.</p>

<p>The images show 7 of those scenes: </p>

<p>The first two were advertisements painted on the McCoy Milling Co. building that still stands and fronts onto River Street. The first is on the north-facing wall, and the second is on the south-facing brick wall that extends out beyond the former Key Bank building (seen in this photo as appearing above the former Mills Diner).</p>

<p>The third image shows the Rexall ad painted on the west wall of the building that was originally known as the Jackson block at the Four Corners (presently vacant, it was last occupied by Mills Restaurant, Leonard’s Restaurant, and Hometown Family Chiropractic). The ad is barely discernible today as the years of weather delivered by strong west winds have faded it into obscurity.</p>

<p>The fourth image is a scene of Chateaugay Lake that was painted on the floor safe that sat in the former Hyland Hardware store on East Main St. It is quite small and has been seen over the years by a very, very small percentage of Chateaugay Citizenry.</p>

<p>The fifth photo shows the stage backdrop (or “drop”) curtain in Cantwell Hall. This assembly space was in the large space on the second floor of the former Pearl’s Department Store building om the south side of East Main Street and was the town’s main performance and meeting place prior to the construction of the Town Hall in 1911. It was donated by Mr. C.W. Henry, and actor and artist, who frequently performed on the Cantwell Hall stage. He painted and gifted it in 1909. It contained a view of the Johnston cottage, which sat on Squaw Island on Chateaugay Lake. This photo of the Cantwell Hall stage was taken around 1910 and shows L to R - Fred Kennedy (cut off), Morton Gillette, Kimball Gilette (the father), Harry Gillette, Ully Campbell, and John Boomhower. The image here is the only clear view of the curtain to have surfaced thus far.</p>

<p>The sixth image is a black and white rendering of the full-color drop curtain in the Town Hall in Brainardsville. It was painted by the same Mr. Henry, who did the Cantwell Hall curtain. This drop curtain had a scene of Chateaugay Lake in the center, and the painted reproductions of the business cards of locals who had built the hall. This original image dates to around 1920.</p>

<p>The seventh, and final photo, is of the drop curtain that hung on the auditorium stage in the new Chateaugay Central School on River Street. This too, was a scene of Chateaugay Lake. Unfortunately, no image of just the curtain itself has been uncovered. The photos we have are peeks at the curtain as it hung behind various class or band photos taken with the groups assembled on stage. At some point over the years, the curtain was removed, and its ultimate fate is unknown.</p>

<p>There you have it; another short glimpse into a little-known or largely overlooked part of our community’s fascinating history…</p>
