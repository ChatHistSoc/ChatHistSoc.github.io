<p>While I was researching in the Library of Congress archives yesterday, I came across a photograph of Chateaugay native, Theodorus Bailey (I have several Bailey portrait images in my files but had never seen this particular one).</p>

<p>He was born in Chateaugay on April 12, 1805. The family lived in the small farmhouse that is now behind Wendy’s Quick Stop on Depot Street. Theodorus was the son of early Chateaugay settler and land speculator, Judge William Bailey.  He joined the US Navy at the age of thirteen, and was warranted as a midshipman. </p>

<p>He served for forty-eight years, rising to the rank of Rear Admiral. He sailed around the world several times during his career and was the military official designated to accept the surrender of the city of New Orleans during the Civil War.</p>

<p>He is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown, Washington D.C.</p>

<p>The Chateaugay post of Civil War veterans, the Grand Army of the Republic or GAR, was renamed in his honor in 1890.</p>

<p>The first photo above is the one I came across while looking through the LOC archives. It was taken by renowned Civil War photographer, Matthew Brady. The second image is of the oil portrait of the Admiral that hangs in the Chateaugay American Legion Post #875. This portrait was done by U.D. Tenney. The third photo is of the Bailey monument in Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>This is actually the second Tenney portrait presented to the local GAR post. The first was destroyed in the fire in January, 1893 which wiped out the north side of East Main Street between River and John Streets, including the meeting rooms of the GAR. Following the fire, one of the Admiral’s sons asked the artist for another portrait to present to the GAR post. The portrait below, which had been painted in 1892, was immediately packed up by Tenney and shipped to Chateaugay.</p> 

<p>In 1929 when the local GAR post was disbanded (because only two very elderly Civil War veterans remained), the portrait was passed on to the local Legion.</p>

<p>This local oil painting was recently repaired and restored through a cooperative effort of the American Legion, the Chateaugay Rotary Club and the Chateaugay Historical Society.</p>

<p>Chateaugay’s history is surely filled with interesting personalities and events. Who knew there was a peripheral Chateaugay connection to Matthew Brady and a local-born Admiral in Chateaugay’s past?...</p>
