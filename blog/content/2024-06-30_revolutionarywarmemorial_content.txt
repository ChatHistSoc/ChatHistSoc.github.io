<p>As we approach the 250th anniversary of the beginnings of the American Revolution, a ceremony was held at the Courthouse in Malone.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I attended the ceremony held by the Adirondack Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The Chapter dedicated a monument to the known Revolutionary War veterans who are buried in Franklin County. </p>

<p>The granite marker is located at the back entrance of the county Courthouse in Malone.</p>

<p>Each township was listed along with its veterans' names. Chateaugay and Burke have a combined nine veterans noted.</p>

<p>This is a very meaningful and appropriate tribute to those who served during the War for Independence.</p>

<p>Thank you to the Adirondack Chapter, DAR for their efforts to make this monument a reality.</p>
