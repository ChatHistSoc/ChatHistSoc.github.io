<p>Earlier today on the "I am From Chateaugay" page, Willard Selkirk posted a photo of a starch mill on the Marble River. This was an image Scott Durant had previously posted. Scott, by the way, has an amazing and vast collection of area historical photos. </p>

<p>Above is the Historical Society's high-resolution scan of the original photo, which was taken by Holmes Photo Studio of Chateaugay in the early 1890s. It is of the Jenkins starch factory on the Earlville Road. A photo of the area, taken this afternoon, is also posted above.</p>

<p>The starch mill was first built by Thomas Bennett around 1850. About 1870, he sold to Adams and Jenkins, who operated it as partners for a short time. It was solely owned and operated by William F. Jenkins from 1871 to 1891, when he sold it to G.H. Main and John Percy. Main's interest in the operation was soon bought out by Nathan Beman (the grandson of Nathan Beman-one of Chateaugay's founders). Beman appears to have been a silent partner as John and Elizabeth Percy operated it until 1893. They ceased operations that year and the mill never operated again.</p>

<p>Charles R. Green bought the vacant starch mill and five acres around it in 1910. The factory building was torn down the same year.</p>

<p>The farm at the top of the hill was owned by Alanson Green and later by Walter and Adelaide Silver. The farm obscured by the trees was owned by Charles Green, and later by Matthew Sheehan, James and Marilyn Jones and Neil and Shirley Cook. The farm on the very top right was owned by P. Bennett, and later by Spencer and Linda Dumont.</p>

<p>The mill dam can be seen to the center right with the penstock running to the mill building. At the center bottom is a spring covered by a pumphouse that sent water up the hill to the farms there.</p>

<p>The child in the buggy is believed to be Gordon Russell Green, son of C.R. Green. The man at the watering trough and the two women standing by the fence are unidentified, but the man and one of the ladies could well be Gordon Green's parents: Charles Russell Green and Cynthia Hawthorne Green. Gordon R. Green would eventually become the president of the First National Bank of Chateaugay.</p>

<p>More on this starch operation in an upcoming article in the Chateaugay Historical Society's newsletter entitled: Starch Factories in Chateaugay. This particular industry is noteworthy as Chateaugay was the top potato producing town on the Rutland Railroad. Not only were uncounted tons of potatoes shipped in bulk by rail, but an equally impressive tonnage ended up in local starch operations.</p>
