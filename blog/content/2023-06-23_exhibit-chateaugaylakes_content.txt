<p>THE CHATEAUGAY HISTORICAL SOCIETY’S NEWEST EXHIBIT IS READY…</p>

<p>Two hundred years ago, in 1823, Paul and Hannah Shepard Merrill arrived in the Chateaugay Lake/Belmont area from Gilmanton, New Hampshire. They had been preceded by Samuel and Judith Drew in 1816 and by the Jackson brothers – Joseph and John – in 1820.<p>

<p>Thus began the era of Chateaugay Lakes recorded history.</p>

<p>Last summer, we presented an exhibit that chronicled the natural history and the early recorded history of the Lakes and surrounding area. This year, we continue the Chateaugay Lakes story as our display illustrated life on and around the Lakes from 1900 to 1950.</p>

<p>Within this period, the stories of both the Lower and Upper Lakes emerge as the historic places and enthralling people who made up the Lakes “experience” are presented. You will find hotels (large and small), interesting and captivating personalities, summer camps filled with laughing kids enjoying all the Lakes area had to offer, places to find a full meal or a quick snack, a thriving “Arts” community led and fueled powerful and supremely talented personalities, and a wide variety of notable camps built by a wide spectrum of those who found the Lakes a wonderful place to visit and enjoy.</p>

<p>The photos show the Archival Center on this eve of the exhibit opening. It shows the layout of the panels of text and photos. Our two new display cases filled with Lake related objects are also featured. The cases were designed and crafted by local Industrial Arts teacher and cabinet maker, Paul LaPlante. They are exquisitely done and add so much to our display capabilities! </p>

<p>The photos here won’t enlarge enough to allow for each panel to be read – more on another photo album that will allow for that in the next few paragraphs.</p>

<p>The selection of photos also shows our public research area, our office space, and other features of the Archival Center. This is what each exhibit visitor will see around them as they arrive to take in “Chateaugay Lakes 1900-1950”.</p>

<p>For those who will be unable to visit in person this summer, we will be posting a second, more in-depth photo essay/album of each piece of the exhibit display later. In that upcoming photo tour later this exhibit season, each and every object, text board, and photo or illustration will be photographed individually and will be able to be enlarged and read in detail. </p>

<p>For now, we hope this set of photos serves as a general introduction of what we have researched, assembled and readied for our visitors.</p>

<p>Stop in and see us. We will be open every Wednesday and Saturday Morning from 9 until noon from tomorrow, June 24, through September 30.</p>
