<p>80 years ago, on December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japanese planes.</p>

<p>To mark this anniversary, Mrs. Shannon McArdle and the Advanced English class at CCS have designed and placed an exhibit in the windows of the Library at the school.</p>

<p>This annual commemoration was begun three years ago thanks to the sponsorship of Joseph Ryan, former Chateaugay resident and son of Pearl Harbor survivor, Joseph J. Ryan. The Historical Society is proud to collaborate with the students and staff in producing this exhibit each fall.</p>

<p>If you are attending any events at the school during December, be sure to stop by the library and take in the display.</p>
