<p>I was stopped at the light at the Four Corners this afternoon. I happened to look over at the Hotel while waiting for the light to change.</p>

<p>Many comments have been made on our Facebook page over the years about how it has fallen into ruin.
However, I'm hoping these photos above prompt some memories of the place way "back in the day" and when it was a busy part of downtown.</p>

<p>The first two are shots from 1935. Note the traffic light in the middle of the intersection. The hotel was called the Chateau then. The lobby had floor-to-ceiling windows so those sitting there could watch traffic and passersby and solve the problems of the world.</p>

<p>The next two are from 1944. Notice the tin ceilings in both the bar and the Arabian Room (dining room). Looking out the window of the dining room, the Dairy and the Liquor Store are right across Depot Street.</p>

<p>The last two are from 1949. The dining room photo shows the smaller bar and the bandstand. The glimpse of the wallpaper on the right compliments the dining room's name, "The Arabian Room".</p>

<p>There were more "glory" years to come - the ‘50s, ‘60s, ‘70s, and on... until it closed for good.</p>
