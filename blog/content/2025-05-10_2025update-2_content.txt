<p>Thanks to all who attended our Kiosk Dedication and Summer Exhibit opening this morning. Unfortunately, the dedication ceremony was held in a light drizzle but was well attended. </p>

<p>Following the brief ceremony on the Chasm Road, we moved to the second floor of the Town Hall for a reception and the 2025 Summer Exhibit entitled: “Chateaugay’s Founders – Nathan Beman and Benjamin Roberts”</p>

<p>We much appreciated the attendance and the positive comments.
The exhibit will be open every Wednesday and Saturday morning from 9am until noon through September 27.</p>

<p>Also, remember to visit Chateaugay’s new <a href="https://chateaugayhistory.org/files/HeritageTrail.pdf" target="new">Heritage Trail</a>. The guide to the 66 locations throughout the Town and Village is available in an on-line version, which can be accessed via the <a href="https://chateaugayhistory.org/Historic-Sites.html" target="new">Historic Sites</a> section of our website or by scanning or photographing the QR code with a smart phone or tablet. the QR code can be found on any of the 30 historic markers located throughout the town and village.<p>

<p><b>A heartfelt thanks go out to...</b></p>

<p>The NYS Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for its approval of our overall plans and the role its funding played in making it possible for our ideas to become a reality</p>

<p>Assemblyman D. Billy Jones for his support and encouragement, especially for the legislative grant which allowed for historic marker purchases</p>

<p>County Legislator Greg Janisewski for his unwavering support of our group and its mission and especially for kick-starting the kiosk construction project</p>

<p>Jeremy Evans, of the Franklin County Industrial Development Agency & Economic Development Corporation, for endorsing our concept of an information kiosk at the Nathan Beman Historical Preserve</p>

<p>The Franklin County Highway Department for installing the culverts at the kiosk site which allowed construction to begin</p>

<p>Chateaugay Supervisor Donald Bilow and the entire Town Board for providing the space for the Archival Center in the Town Hall, and for supporting and encouraging the Society’s visions for all of our ongoing projects to preserve and highlight Chateaugay’s Past</p>

<p>Nicole Davis and the entire staff at Davis Designs and Printing for flawlessly producing our publications and for honoring our order requests, no matter how “last minute” they might have been, with good grace, professionalism, and the highest quality printing production</p>

<p>Because of all of the efforts noted above, Chateaugay now has a “monument” to our founder, Nathan Beman, and a 66-location Heritage Trail for residents and visitors to enjoy, while using either an on-line version or a full color resource book as a guide. It really does take a whole community working together to bring concepts to reality. Thank you all.</p>
