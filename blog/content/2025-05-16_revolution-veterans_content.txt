<p>Just to put a final footnote on the Historical Society's events of last weekend. We celebrated our founders, Nathan Beman and Benjamin Roberts, and noted that they were both veterans of the American Revolution.</p>

<p>Pictured is a list of the 13 men that served in that war and that were buried in the soil of Chateaugay.</p>

<p>Although our community was not settled until 1796, which was 13 years after the war ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Chateaugay still has a very real and a very strong connection to those who served in the conflict that gave birth to our nation.</p>

<p>Some of these men were in Chateaugay in the earliest years of the community, and others moved here somewhat later, but all were laid to rest here and deserve recognition for their service.</p>
