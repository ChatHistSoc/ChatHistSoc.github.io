<p>This blog post had its beginnings in a conversation I had with Geri Favreau, president of the Clinton County Historical Association, about an ecclesiastical painter named Angelo Metallo who did murals at the former St. Philomena’s/Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Churubusco and in St. Patrick’s Church in Rouses Point. It turns out that he also did painting at St. Patrick’s in Chateaugay. Who knew?? According to the August 17, 1928 issue of the <i>Chateaugay Record</i>, Professor Metallo was “decorating the interior of St. Patrick’s” and would be moving on to a similar contract at the church in Churubusco.</p>

<p>Naturally, I went back into our files to see if there was any information about paintings that were done at St. Patrick’s in Chateaugay. I found many photos of the Catholic Churches in Chateaugay over the years but nothing about any specific murals or scenes. I took some new photos of the present church and decided while the research into Professor Metallo continues, and a post (or newsletter article) about him and his works will eventually appear, that I would do a blog post on the three Catholic Churches that have been on West Main Street over the last 178 years—with photos.</p>

<p>The first was built in 1844 by Father James Keveny of Hogansburg. Masses were said in the new church very intermittently due to the large territory that Father Keveny had to minister to. The local church and the one in Malone were mission churches of Hogansburg until 1848. Chateaugay then became a mission of the newly formed St. Joseph’s Parish in Malone with Father Bernard McCabe as pastor. St. Patrick's Church of Chateaugay was officially incorporated under his leadership on August 16th, 1848.</p> 

<p>In 1856, this original, very small church was destroyed by the tornado that tore through the Fort Covington, Burke and Chateaugay communities, destroying over 360 buildings in Chateaugay alone. The cyclonic winds and baseball sized hailstones flattened the little Catholic Church on what is now West Main Street. For the next three years, Masses were said in various buildings in the village.</p>

<p>No photos or other depictions of that first church are known to exist. It has only been described as wood-framed and quite small. </p>

<p>Finally, in 1859, construction of a new, larger church was begun on the same site on West Main (the area where the American Legion and a private home now stand). Father Anthony Theves, pastor of St. Joseph's Church in Malone and its missions in Chateaugay and Brushton began the construction of the new building. The citizens of Chateaugay donated everything from money, grain, potatoes, their labor and other items so that construction of the new church could begin. However, it proved to be a slow and frustrating process. Four years later in 1863, only four walls and a roof had been constructed.</p>

<p>That same year, St. Patrick’s Church in Chateaugay was established as an autonomous parish with Father Edmund DePauw as the first resident pastor. He approached the Chateaugay assignment with a dedication and fervor that impressed his parishioners. The congregation grew and his next challenge was the partially constructed second church. When he arrived, he described it as: “little better than a barn, with no pews, badly heated, and so unfinished that the snow found entrance, and the sacred wine froze in the chalice." The church construction was eventually completed with an ornate high altar, pews, steeple with a bell, and all the expected and required décor and statuary. Sheds for horse and buggy rigs sat to the east of the church.</p>

<p><Unfortunately, disaster struck the parish of 2,000 on Wednesday, July 12, 1916. At 9pm, a powerful thunder and lightning storm hit the community. A lightning strike hit the bell tower and the church was burned to the ground within an hour. One legend has it that the only thing saved from the burning building was a statue of the Virgin Mary. Some accounts say other artifacts and items were successfully removed.</p>

<p>The first photos above show three different views of this second Catholic Church. The first is a postcard. The second is a Henry Beach photo and the third is another postcard. Next is a photo of the interior of the old church. The resolution is very poor but one can still get a sense of the interior and the high altar on the back wall. The final photo is a much clearer image of the altar, showing the ornate design.</p>

<p>After being forced to wait for seven years after losing their church to the lightning-caused fire, the St. Patrick’s congregation finally saw the beginning construction of their new home. This would become the present-day St. Patrick’s Church just west of the Four Corners. The inflation which followed WWI had stalled building plans. Masses were held in other larger buildings (a roller skating rink and Sprague’s garage) on West Main while construction was delayed.</p>

<p>On July 8, 1923, the Bishop presided over the laying of the cornerstone for the new building. By the end of the next year, the exterior was largely complete. The first Mass said in the new St. Patrick’s was Midnight Mass on December 24, 1924. Interior finishing then followed. And, according to the <i>Chateaugay Record</i>, Angelo Metallo was part of the interior decorating being done in 1928. The Italian marble altar and fifty-four foot communion rail were installed in 1930. The stained glass windows would follow and the entire interior was eventually completed during the 1930s.</p>

<p>There are six photos above of the completed, present-day building through the years. The first is a view of the Church with the original bell tower. The second shows the Church today with the copper sheathed spire which was installed in 1986. The third and fourth images are of the original white marble high altar, followed by a photo of the altar in 1982 (after the Vatican II renovations were completed) and finishing with a photo of the altar area, or apse, today.</p>

<p>More on Professor Metallo to come…</p>
