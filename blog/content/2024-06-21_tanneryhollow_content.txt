<p>I have recently been doing some research for a future article on "Tannery Hollow". Anyone who grew up here knows of the hollow down at the Boardman Brook, on the east end of the village. It is referred to daily in uncounted conversations as a present-day location but few of us think about what the "hollow" was in days past. What was once there? Was it a busy section of the village? Why is it called "Tannery Hollow"?</p>

<p>Here is a preview of some of the material that will appear in that eventual article in an upcoming issue of our newsletter...</p>

<p>There were homes built there in the earliest years of Chateaugay's settlement. Industries were established on the banks of the brook starting in 1820. Commercial activity in the hollow ended in 1912.</p>

<p>Among the industries found there during its 92 year-long business history were: a foundry, a grist mill, a saw mill, a cabinet shop, a butter factory, a coffin shop, a slaughterhouse, a carding mill, a cider mill, a shingle mill, and a cabinet shop.</p>

<p>In addition to the industries already mentioned, the largest of the businesses found in Tannery Hollow was the expansive H.A. Douglas tannery. It was a massive building: 225 feet long, 28 feet wide and seven stories high. It was the largest tannery in New York State by the late 1880s. </p>

<p>When it burned to the ground on May 13, 1891, it employed over 100 men and used over 3,000 cords of hemlock bark to tan its constant influx of hides.</p>

<p>Although the tannery was the largest industry in the hollow, the other businesses also employed a significant number of local men. All told, Tannery Hollow had the largest concentration of local industrial activity for almost 100 years.</p>

<p>Today, Tannery Hollow is relatively quiet, with only the heavy traffic of Route 11 disturbing the tranquility of the few homes found there.</p>

<p>The upcoming full-length newsletter article on the hollow will include descriptions of all of the businesses once found there, a series of nine maps tracing the historical development of the area, and many illustrations.</p>

<p>Shown above is a drawing of the Douglas Tannery as it operated and a sketch of the scene following the fire that leveled it.</p>

<p>More to come in an upcoming newsletter issue...</p>
