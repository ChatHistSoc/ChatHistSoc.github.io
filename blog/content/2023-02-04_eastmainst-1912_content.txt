<p>This photo was taken in the spring of 1912. The view is looking eastward on East Main Street. The Town Hall is just one year old and later in the summer of 1912, Main Street will be paved. Note the tall elm trees that lined the street. The man and his team on the left are coming out of John Street. The Kissane block that stood (part of it still stands) between John Street and the Town Hall had not been rebuilt yet, following a fire that destroyed it. And, not a "motorcar" in sight (as they would have said back then).</p>
