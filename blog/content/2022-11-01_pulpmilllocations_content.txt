<p>Working on some research tonight on the Chateaugay Pulp and High Falls Pulp companies on the Chateaugay River. Ended up placing them on a vintage map to show their locations relative to one another and to the village.</p> 

<p>In the map: north is to the top, the "Four Corners" is marked with a blue dot, and I have also included the half mile racetrack that was on the fairgrounds at the end of Collins Street (the Chateaugay Agricultural Society held four annual fairs at the grounds from 1908 through 1911).</p> 

<p>There was a rail spur that was built from the west end of the railyard south to the High Falls operation. Plans were discussed to extend the spur to the Chateaugay Pulp facility farther upriver, but it was never constructed.</p> 

<p>The two mills required thousands of cords of wood each year to manufacture paper pulp. The logs were put on the ice at Chateaugay Lake each winter, and log drives each spring took them downriver to the two mills.</p>

<p>At their busiest, the two mills employed several hundred local men. The High Falls plant closed in 1930 and the Chateaugay Pulp operation was shuttered a few years later. These large mills led the way for local employment "back in the day".</p>
