<p>Another Chateaugay native, Col. James Hyland Ryan, has passed.  His obituary is pictured. I worked with Jim on many Historical Society projects. Some thoughts:</p>
<p>Jim,</p>
<p>I am saddened to learn of your passing but grateful that I got to know you during your summer visits back to "Good Old Chateaugay".</p>
<p>My sincere condolences to Doreen and the entire family. Your life was one so very well-lived. Your faith, your kindness, and your enthusiasm were your hallmarks.</p>
<p>Through the Chateaugay Historical Society, I have had the pleasure of talking with hundreds of current and former Chateaugay residents over the years. I have met very few, if any, who had as deep and as genuine a love for his hometown as you, my friend.</p>
<p>You enthusiastically endorsed our group and its mission. You wrote many articles for our newsletter over the years and visited us to take in our summer exhibits. </p>
<p>I especially enjoyed co-writing “Service, Faith and Community: The Legacy of the Hyland Brothers” with you and John Hyland.</p>
<p>You were always so willing to share your memories of Chateaugay and of your family along with photos and “stories”. Your support for our group was so very welcome and very much appreciated.</p>
<p>I always looked forward to seeing you and having a chance to catch up. I will miss our chats and your support and encouragement. </p>
<p>They will always be treasured memories for me.</p>
<p>Thank you for your service, your life well-lived, and your friendship.</p>
<p>My thoughts and prayers are with your entire family.</p>
<p>Rest well.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Mick</p>
