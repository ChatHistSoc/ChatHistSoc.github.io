<p>Father Donald Gallagher was pastor of St. Patrick's Church from 1954, following the untimely death of Father Ambrose Hyland, until his death in 1959.</p>

<p>He graduated from Notre Dame University. He was the Senior Class president there. He was ordained in Rome and served throughout the North Country before coming to Chateaugay.</p>

<p>He served in the Pacific Theater in the US Navy during WWII.</p>

<p>I remember he lay in state in St. Patrick's Church prior to his funeral and we school kids were allowed to attend to pay our respects.</p>

<p>The images included in this post are his official pastoral portrait from St. Patrick's, the page of tribute in the CCS yearbook from the spring of 1960,  photos from his Notre Dame yearbook, and a photo taken 20 years after his Notre Dame graduation and just before his commission as a First Lieutenant in the US Navy.</p>

<p>I remember him to have been very kind and caring. He and Father Igo were my favorites as a kid.</p>
