<p>A few weekends ago, I posted information and images of the local Railroad operation. Since then, I have been doing more research into the local RR operation. Below is a summary of the freight operation that happened at the local depot. Also shown here are four views of the railyard. The first is from a map of the village in 1876. The next three are crops from various Sanborn Insurance Co. maps from 1899, 1905 and 1912 respectively. None of the images show the sidings at the Milk Plant nor the siding that went south to High Falls Pulp and Paper Co. Needless to say, the railyard was a very busy place.</p>

<p><h3><b>Freight Shipments at the Height of the Chateaugay RR Station’s Influence:</b></h3></p>

<p>During the 1880s and 1890s, the Chateaugay station was considered to be the “greatest freight shipping station in Northern New York”.  It was stated that “there is more freight sent from this station than from any other three stations on the O. & L.C. railroad and more than from any one station north of Albany.”</p>

<p><b><u>Some Examples:</p></b></u>

<p><u><b>1881 </u></b>– A butter and egg train left this station carrying 780 tubs of butter each weighing 52.5 lbs. and 42 cases of eggs weighing a total of 5350 lbs. The cargo on this train was valued at over $100,000 [equal to about $4.4M in 2019!].</p>

<p><u><b>1896 </u></b>– During the last week of September, the following products were shipped from the Chateaugay station:</p>

<p><center>49 carloads of potatoes</center></p>
<p><center>494 box cars of livestock</center></p>
<p><center>4914 carloads of pulp</center></p>

<p><u><b>1897</u></b> – The sheer volume of freight originating from the Chateaugay railyard prompted the company to build two new turnout tracks (sidings) to accommodate the traffic. They were placed at the west end of the railyard.</p>

<p>During the week ending Wednesday, September 29, the following shipments were recorded:</p>
 
<p><center>13 cars of potatoes</center></p>
<p><center>3 cars of calves</center></p>
<p><center>2 cars of sheep</center></p>
<p><center>1 car of bulls</center></p>
<p><center>1 car of hogs</center></p>
<p><center>21 cars of pulp</center></p>
<p><center>5 cars of starch</center></p>
<p><center>1 car of horses</center></p>
<p><center>1 car of butter</center></p>

<p>Between September 24 and October 15, 39 carloads of potatoes (about 30,000 bushels) were shipped. Estimated value was $10,000 which would equal just over $300,000 in 2019.</p>

<p><u><b>1898 </u></b>– During the first week of potato shipping, 259 boxcars were loaded and sent. There were 50 bushels in each car making the total 29,800 bushels shipped. Total value: $8700 (equivalent to about $270,000 today).</p>

<p>With numbers like those above, it is not hard to imagine the level of activity at the railyard during these years. The wagon loads of goods being delivered to the freight yard for shipment, the men unloading the wagons and then loading the waiting boxcars, the trains coming in to deliver empty cars to be laden and the new trains being coupled and prepared for departure, all combined to produce a bustling scene which captured the prosperity the railroad brought to our little town.<p>

<p>The railroad provided Chateaugay’s industrial and agricultural producers access to distant markets. The town thrived during the RR years. By 1890, the use of refrigerated cars revolutionized agricultural shipping from the Chateaugay station as it allowed the shipment of liquid milk and other perishable products. Among the most frequently shipped freight:</p>

<li><b>LIVESTOCK</b> – Sheep, cattle, hogs and calves were the most common shipments.</li>

<li><b>EGGS</b> – As noted previously, large quantities of eggs were shipped regularly.</li>

<li><b>BUTTER</b> – There were several butter factories in town during the RR years.</li>

<li><b>POTATOES</b> – Chateaugay produced more potatoes than any other town on the entire Ogdensburg & Lake Champlain Railroad.</li>

<li><b>STARCH</b> – A byproduct of the huge potato crops, starch was produced by several local, starch factories and shipped in barrels.</li>

<li><b>PULP </b>– Thanks to our two large, local pulp operations, carload after carload of paper pulp was shipped from the Chateaugay station. Chateaugay Pulp Company and High Falls Pulp Company, both located on the Chateaugay River, took advantage of the dense woodlands that surrounded the area to produce untold tons of pulp. High Falls had built a rail spur from the railyard to their operation to make shipment easier. Chateaugay Pulp had discussed extension of the spur to their operation, a mile away but that never came to pass. Their product was either taken to the High Falls loading facility or brought directly to the railyard by horse and wagon teams. Chateaugay Pulp Company was wholly owned by the Johnston family. High Falls was formed and owned by various local investors. </li>

<li><b>HORSES</b> – Chateaugay always had a love affair with horses, both work or draft horses and fine thoroughbreds. Horse racing was a constant in town. On many occasions, traffic would be stopped on Main Street as a race would be set up to prove bragging rights and to settle arguments among horse owners as to whose horse was fastest. There was also Silver’s Driving Park on the Chasm Road and, later, the half mile track at the Chateaugay Agricultural Society fairgrounds at the end of Collins Street. In fact, at the fairgrounds, horse barns far outnumbered the cattle and other livestock sheds. There was also winter racing with horses racing with cleated horseshoes on ice surfaces. The racetrack at the fairgrounds was regularly iced over during the cold winters. Races were also held on Chateaugay Lake. There were also a few successful draft horse operations that regularly shipped their stock.</li>

<li><b>EXCELSIOR </b>– There were three excelsior companies (Chateaugay Excelsior, Star Excelsior, and Globe Excelsior) that shipped bales of their product. Excelsior was used as packing for fragile items and as stuffing for furniture and children’s toys. This product was also a byproduct of the extensive area forests.</li>

<li><b>LUMBER</b> – The numerous local sawmills produced more lumber than was needed locally. Carloads of the excess lumber were frequently leaving the Chateaugay freight yard, bound for distant markets. A large planning mill was even built in the railyard by George T. Hall to allow finished lumber to compliment the rough lumber shipments.</li>

<li><b>MILK </b>– As noted above, with the advent of refrigeration, tanks of liquid milk, and later condensed milk, could be shipped to destinations far from Chateaugay.</li>

<li><b>IRON ORE </b>– In the earliest years of the mining operation in Lyon Mountain, wagon loads of smelted iron “pigs” were drawn to the Chateaugay RR station for shipment along a plank road that stretched from the local depot to the Forge at the outlet of Chateaugay Lake. This was a large money-maker for the Ogdensburg & Lake Champlain Railroad. Unfortunately for the local rail line, the Chateaugay Railroad would eventually be built from Plattsburgh to Dannemora to Lyon Mountain. This meant that iron ore could be shipped more easily and cheaper on the new Chateaugay Railroad than drawing it to the local station and that revenue stream dried up.</li>

<p>Of course, many other products were shipped from the Chateaugay freight depot as well. The listing above just summarizes some of the products shipped in extreme quantities. </p>

<p>The railyard was constantly growing. Additional sidings were being built regularly to allow for the loading and unloading of various freight shipments. The RR grounds were easily the busiest place in the village with activity taking place almost twenty-four hours a day.</p>
