<p>Chateaugay Central School senior, Luke Dalton, joined the Historical Society's December meeting to personally present a signed copy of a children's book he wrote and published for his senior project titled "The Little Bulldog Leads the Way". </p>

<p>Dalton shared his inspiration for writing the book in a post on the School's Facebook page, dated November 6, 2023: "I have a passion for writing and equally a pride for being a Bulldog, I thought what better way to use them both to write a book for the elementary students at our school. I will be reading this book to each of the [elementary] classes in January."</p>

<p>The book, penned by Dalton and illustrated by Tina Vanderhoef, contains messages about being a positive example in your school and community. It is a wonderful addition to our local author's collection. Great work and thank you, Luke!</p>
