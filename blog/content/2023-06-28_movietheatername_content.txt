<p>This year’s second issue of the Historical Society’s newsletter is on its way—another 28-page, photo-filled edition! Watch for it in your mailboxes.</p>

<p>One of the articles in this issue tells the story of Chateaugay’s various entertainment venues over the last 150 years.</p>

<p>I just came upon an article in the Chateaugay Record that directly relates to that entertainment article in this newsletter, so it seemed appropriate to note that news article here as the newsletter copies make their way to each of you via the Postal System…</p>

<p>First a little background…Movies began in the Town Hall soon after its construction was completed in 1911. The Town Hall burned in 1940 and was quickly rebuilt within the next year.</p>

<p>Tobin and Quinlin had shown movies in the Town Hall prior to the fire as the “Ideal Theater.” </p>

<p>Following the rebuild, Tobin left the partnership and the Quinlin family prepared to move forward but decided the theater needed a new name.</p>

<p>A community-wide contest was held and scores of proposed theater names were submitted. The complete list of contest submissions is in the photo box below. There certainly was much interest in the theater operation!</p>

<p>There were quite a few repeated entries, but over 110 different suggestions were made. There was a large and eager group of movie fans awaiting the reopening of the theater.</p>

<p>Louise Chase and Alice Hilliker each separately submitted what would become the Quinlin family’s final choice: The Gay Theatre. The family showed movies for the next 20+ years under that banner.</p>

<p>Check out the list above. My personal favorite was “Quin-Land”…</p>
