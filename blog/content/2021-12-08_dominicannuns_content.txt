<p>While Chateaugay did not have a Catholic school, there was a small convent of the Dominican Nuns (4-6 nuns at any one time) that were active in the community from 1953 to 1965. The nuns taught released-time religious classes, organized church activities, assisted the priests with church programs and services, and left quite a mark on the community. </p>

<p>The first Mother Superior was Sister Margaret Mary.</p>

<p>In working on research for an eventual article, we sought out local memories of the Dominicans. The following are what members of the Chateaugay community had to share on Facebook.</p>

<li>“Sadly I don't remember their names. My favorite sister had an artificial leg and a good sense of humor.”</li>

<li>“I remember sister Margaret Mary very well. I learned how to knit from the Dominican nuns!”</li>

<li>“I remember knitting lessons also, sitting on the stairs in the front entryway of the convent.”</li>

<li>“I remember them very well. I attended ‘summer ccd classes’ every summer at St Patrick’s. We would sometimes have art classes in their convent kitchen. I believe the house was on Depot Street but we always went there by taking a path from St Pat’s up through back yards to their house. Ironically, that same group of Dominican nuns ended up in Fall River, MA where they ran a school for kindergarten through eighth grade that was open until the late 1980’s. I belonged to a local glee club in Fall River and we rehearsed in their auditorium for many years. One of the singers in the Glee Club had been in the novitiate and spent a summer in Chateaugay with the sisters.”</li>

<li>“They were my across the street neighbors. My grandmother went to their evening knitting sessions once a week. While knitting everyone sampled the wine the sisters had received as Christmas presents. The next day there was a lot of ripping out to pick up dropped stitches.”</li>

<li>“I loved the nuns. They taught me how to knit.”</li>

<li>“I also remembered the Nuns when they lived on Depot Street.”</li>

<li>“I learned how to knit from the nuns too. And it is still one of my favorite pastime. I always looked forward to going there.”</li>

<li>“We attended religious classes 1/2 day during summer and at least once a week during the school sessions some in summer were outside”</li>

<li>“Spent many a day at the convent with the nuns. I also took knitting classes there and made slippers, and they taught me how to make pom poms.”</li>
