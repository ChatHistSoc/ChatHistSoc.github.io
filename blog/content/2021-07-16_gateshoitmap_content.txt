<p>The Historical Society has been so very fortunate since our founding in 2007. Countless people have donated to our growing collection; providing artifacts, documents, and photographs regarding Chateaugay's history that might otherwise have been discarded or lost.</p>

<p>Every item donated to our organization is accessioned, evaluated by a trained conservator (if appropriate), and then stored in our climate controlled storage areas using approved and accepted archival methods and materials.</p> 

<p>As our collection has grown, some objects have stood out for their significance and uniqueness.
For example, the oldest written artifact in our collection is a hand drawn map of the world drawn in 1800 by Gates Hoit. He was one of Chateaugay's most influential and consequential early citizens. He arrived with the first wave of settlers following the initial settlement by Nathan Beman and Benjamin Roberts in 1796.</p>

<p>Our archives now contain all of the Gates Hoit papers known to exist. The letters, deeds, ledgers and other documents are now in the process of being accessioned, sorted, conserved, scanned and transcribed so they can be made available to researchers. By scanning and transcribing them, they can be accessed for study without the need to constantly handle the fragile originals.</p>

<p>The first photo below is a high resolution scan of the Gates Hoit map. The second photo was written by Carrie Hoit McCoy. It explains the history, or the provenance, of the map. The writing is on a piece of brown paper that packaged the map when it was in storage in a trunk in the McCoy house on West Main Street.</p> 

<p>This map is just one small part of our constantly growing archival holdings. Thanks everyone for your continued and committed support of our organization.</p>
