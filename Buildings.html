        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>This weekend we will again explore another building, but not a business property in the village like the last two weekends. About two miles east of the village limits is property on the south side of Route 11 that originally belonged to one of Chateaugay’s first settlers. </p>

<p>Samuel Stoughton came here in the earliest years of Chateaugay’s founding. He is listed in the 1798 Tax Assessment for Clinton County (Franklin County had not been established yet) as the owner of 150 acres.</p>

<p>Part of his property became the farm of his son, Samuel W. Stoughton. The younger Samuel had been born in 1812, a time when Chateaugay’s population was small and most of the land was still heavily forested. In addition, there were considerable troop movements through the town and a sizable presence of troops camped here all during the war of 1812.</p>

<p>Samuel W. eventually married Margaret Witherspoon in 1843. Over the next 30 years, they farmed the land and had a family of nine children. In the 1870s they sold to their son, James H. Stoughton and his wife, Nancy.</p>

<p>It was James and a man named Polick that built the barn which is today’s topic. In 1884, this innovative dairy barn was constructed and became the centerpiece of the farm. But, before describing the structure itself, let’s look at the owners that bring the farm into the present.</p>

<p>In 1887, James Stoughton passed away at the age of 36. The next year his wife sold the property to Wolford Smith. For almost 25 years, the Smiths farmed and raised their family.</p>

<p>In 1912, George McGregor bought the farm and kept dairy cows until 1944 when he sold to Thomas and Margaret Dupree. Their son, Bob, and his wife Edna bought in 1960 and raised their family there. The farm is currently owned by their children.</p>

<p>The barn was designed to accommodate the lay of the land and was basically built into the sloping hillside. During one of the times I stopped over to visit with Bob, we got talking about the barn and he related the story behind the building and its layout. It was considered to be quite state-of-the-art when built and later became one of the first to install a modern milking system.</p>

<p> When Bob’s father bought the farm, he found the barn to be much as it was when originally built. The milking was done on the ground floor; milk house in the front and the cattle behind. Much of this level was below ground level, helping it to retain the heat thrown off by the cows in the winter and keeping the summer heat out and making it cooler during warmer weather.</p>

<p>The barn was built to allow a horse team to walk into the second level hay mow from the back of the barn. Once the hay was unloaded, there was a turntable in the floor that allowed the team and wagon to be spun around and driven straight out the doors in the back. The Duprees eventually removed the turntable but the basic structure of the barn remained the same.</p>

<p>The years have taken their toll and the masonry is deteriorating at this point. Bob told me that he and his father before him always made sure to keep a good roof on the building. With that, the framing remains largely intact and unaffected.</p>

<p>In 1984, the Chateaugay Record featured the barn in a front page article, calling it the “Centennial Barn” and briefly tracing its history.</p>

<p>After our conversation about the building, my next request was to be able to take photos of it. Bob readily said “sure” and off I went with my camera. What follows is a sampling of the photos I took that day. They show another unique Chateaugay treasure that is part of the fabric our great hometown.</p>

        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>We looked at the Chateaugay bank building last weekend. This time, let’s turn to the Anderson Block on the north side of East Main Street. This structure was built following the great fire of 1893 which destroyed every building between River Street and John Street. Mary Humiston wrote an account of this blaze in the very first edition of our newsletter in 2007. 
The temps were far below zero and the wind was blowing a gale on the night of the fire. The Fire Department had no chance against those daunting conditions. When the sun rose the next morning, the entire block was in ruins. In fact, the embers had even swirled around and ignited the small store west of the blaze on the corner of River and West Main. This, too, was destroyed. In fact, that newly vacant lot made construction of the new bank possible (but that was last week’s post). </p>
<p>Many owners on East Main Street immediately began to make plans to rebuild. Others sold the property and buyers scooped up the suddenly available lots and made plans for new business buildings. A new village ordinance mandated that all newly constructed business district structures had to be of masonry, not wood construction.
Mrs. Rudolphus Anderson, born Cornelia Smith, made plans for the building shown in the first photo below. Mrs. Anderson certainly had the financial means to construct the imposing building that she wanted. Her late father was Judge Henry Smith. He was the son of Col. Thomas Smith (who owned Smith’s Tavern that had originally stood at the corner of River and East Main) and the grandson of Major Jacob Smith (who was one of Chateaugay’s earliest settlers and had built a small tannery at his property on what is now the Earlville Road.) Jacob Smith had fought in the Revolutionary War and Thomas had served in the War of 1812.</p>
<p>Judge Henry Smith was an astute businessman as well as a prominent civic leader and politician. When he died, he was reputed to be the richest man in Franklin County with extensive real estate and business holdings in Chateaugay and the surrounding area. His daughters inherited his fortune. Cornelia married Rudolphus Anderson and two of her sisters married two of the Cantwell brothers (of Cantwell Hall fame, etc.). Cornelia had both her father’s keen business instincts and the financial means to construct an impressive and noteworthy building. </p>
<p>I am currently researching a long article for our newsletter that will tell the story of the Smiths, Andersons and the Cantwells (The Smiths were a story in themselves with several consequential members who impacted Chateaugay’s history in many major ways. The Cantwells were part of the family of attorneys in Malone as well as Cantwell’s Hall [which Phyllis Thompson wrote of in an article in our newsletter]. Rudolphus and Cornelia Smith Anderson were the parents of Col. K.S. Anderson and his three brothers). Watch for that Smith/Anderson/Cantwell article in a future newsletter issue. 
Now, back to Mrs. Anderson. She wanted her building to be the most noteworthy and impressive of all of the new construction as downtown bounced back from that devastating 1893 fire. She worked with Malone architect, G.S. Croff, to design the structure that would bring her vision to life. </p>
<p>Originally, plans were made for a brick building to match every one of the other new structures, but she changed her mind and ended up facing the front with Gouverneur marble and adding stained glass panels to the second floor. All the new buildings planned to install stained glass panels over the first floor store-front windows but she added that same feature to the second floor windows as well. In addition, she had all the trim and ceilings on both floors done in select-grade whitewood. All of the ceiling, door, window and cabinet construction and trim were painstakingly installed, oiled and finished with coats of shellac. She also insisted on premium fixtures throughout.
All of the block reconstruction from River to John Streets that followed the 1893 fire was completed within a year.</p>
<p>The Anderson (some refer to it as the Bessette) block has seen a significant number of tenants and businesses over the last fifty years or so and a significant portion of the inside has been remodeled with many of the original features having been replaced or covered over. </p>
<p>In 2018, I was able to accompany a county official into the vacant building and take a series of photos. We discovered a leak in the roof which was subsequently patched. The block is in the County’s possession today.</p>
<p>Should the building ever find itself in a private owner’s hands again someday, there will be issues to contend with: the front stonework and back brickwork need repointing to replace deteriorating mortar joints, an entirely new roof should be installed, the exterior woodwork and trim badly needs either reconditioning, repair or replacement, and the interior would require much care and attention as well. 
Is this block the “grand dame” of the remaining business blocks on Main Street? Who can say, but she surely still has the potential to be a showcase of 1890s commercial construction in Chateaugay. </p>
<p>Following are some of the shots I took that day. Some of the photos show original construction details and design while others show more recent changes and remodeling that has been done over the years.</p>
<p>I was very impressed as I went through it from basement to second floor. Enough of the original features of Mrs. Anderson’s construction plan still exist to clearly show how her vision for the building was made reality as it rose from the ashes of that devastating 1893 fire.</p>

        <div class="blog-text">
                  <p>The Chateaugay branch of Key Bank closed almost two years ago. The building sits empty today. When it was built in late 1890s, it quickly became one of the busiest spots in the business district. </p>

<p>The bank used a portion of the first floor for its lobby and located several banking offices in the lowest level. The rest of the first floor and the second housed several retail businesses over the early years. The third floor was used as a meeting space for the Grand Army of the Republic at first and then the Masonic Lodge used the floor. </p>

<p>The third space was (is) a large, open space with a small enclosed area for storage and any kitchen needs.</p>

<p>Before the bank was closed, I was allowed to go into the third floor to take a few photos. No pictures were allowed in the basement office and vault area, nor on the first floor and second floor with the meeting room and a third vault.</p>

<p>What happens next for the building is unsure. It is currently for sale. I remember thinking, as I stood in that third floor space, that with full glass on the east and south walls it would make an amazing studio apartment.</p>

<p>Included here is an image of the bank shortly after it opened and the main entrance was on the corner. The next photo shows the bank more recently with the entrance on the west side of the building's front. The last two shots show the space on the third floor. Even though it has not been used for many years, it is easy to see how well finished the room was when it was new.</p>

<p>Another Chateaugay landmark transitions to an uncertain future...</p>
