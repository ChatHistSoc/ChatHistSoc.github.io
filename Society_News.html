        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>Our first newsletter issue of 2022 will be mailed this coming Tuesday. This issue contains articles about: the two airplanes built in Chateaugay during the 60s and 70s, a history of all the businesses in the Jackson/Mitchell block (where Jimmy Mills moved to, on the corner of East Main and Depot) over the years since its construction in 1876, a reminiscence by Royal Nadeau of threshing day in the 40s, and the story of the Smith/Alvord/Cook house (Odie and Barb Cook's stone house) on East Main, from its construction in 1818, to the present.</p>

<p>Lots to read and see (we have again included many, many illustrations and photos throughout the 28 pages). Members, watch your mailboxes!</p>

<p>Also, planning continues for the summer exhibit. It will tell the story of the early years on Chateaugay Lake, from the first settlers through the later 1800s and the construction of the Forge dam, which changed the surface area of the Lakes and the Narrows and helped both the tourist and the iron mining industries thrive.</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight the early settlers, the earliest sporting visitors, the first schoolhouses, methods of transportation - on the lakes as well as to and from them, the seasonal Native American presence, as well as the Native legends of the Lakes, and a full-color, framed, and matted display of the seven A.F. Tait paintings and lithographs set in the Chateaugay Lakes area. Tait produced these works in the mid-1800s, when he was a frequent visitor to the Bellows House (later, the Banner House).</p>

<p>Plan on visiting the Archival Center this summer to take it in! Opening date to be published here soon...</p>

<p>As you can see, we have been (and will continue to be) busy producing content for both members and the general public - all made possible by your continued memberships and support.</p> 

<p>Thank you so much!</p>

<p>Above is an image of the first page from the upcoming issue. Also shown is an illustration a friend sent me. I think it's good for a chuckle or two.</p>

<p>Think spring!!</p>

        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>At first glance, the photos above don’t seem to be Chateaugay history-related. But, they are actually a part of the two major projects we are working on right now.</p> 

<p>First, is our newsletter preparation; which is an on-going process. We are editing our next issue, which will be mailed to members next month. We think you will enjoy the upcoming articles – everything from airplane building in Chateaugay, to an historic home in the village, to a very notable business block on East Main and also a memory of farming in the 1940s.</p>

<p>Our second project is our upcoming summer exhibit. The research and development necessary for the display has begun in earnest. It will open on June 29th and will be available for viewing all summer. It will examine the Early Years of the History of Chateaugay Lake. Among our exhibit display topics will be: </p>

<li>The earliest settlement and settlers</li>
<li>Transportation and its development as people and commerce came and went from the early Lakes</li>
<li>The building of the Forge Dam and the effects of raising the water levels of the Lakes and the Narrows</li>
<li>The Native American seasonal presence on the Lake and the various legends that have been told about their time in the area</li> 
<li>A look at the earliest country schools in the area around the Lakes</li>
<li>A framed display of the works of artist, Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait. He visited the Bellows Lake House (later known as the Banner House) for several years during the mid-1800s. We have seven of his works that we believe were set in the area around Chateaugay Lake. </li>

<br />

<p>As the photos show, the framing of the Tait prints is well under way. The specific image included above (3/3) is probably the one we are all most familiar with. This ice fishing scene will be available at the exhibit, not in the version shown here, but as a large vintage print, mounted in a wonderful, ornate antique frame. The other six Tait scenes will all be newly matted and framed and will show his works both as original oil paintings and as lithographs produced by Currier and Ives. Each view will be complimented with a text panel, explaining the history and details of each work.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to readying the newsletter for our members. We think we have another interesting and well-illustrated issue. The summer exhibit promises to be both information filled and eye catching. We hope you enjoy them both.</p>

<p>Our group may be small, but we try to remain busy and working to present more of the history of Chateaugay and area each year. </p>

<p>Thanks for your continued support.</p>

        <p>80 years ago, on December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japanese planes.</p>

<p>To mark this anniversary, Mrs. Shannon McArdle and the Advanced English class at CCS have designed and placed an exhibit in the windows of the Library at the school.</p>

<p>This annual commemoration was begun three years ago thanks to the sponsorship of Joseph Ryan, former Chateaugay resident and son of Pearl Harbor survivor, Joseph J. Ryan. The Historical Society is proud to collaborate with the students and staff in producing this exhibit each fall.</p>

<p>If you are attending any events at the school during December, be sure to stop by the library and take in the display.</p>

        <p>The Historical Society has been so very fortunate since our founding in 2007. Countless people have donated to our growing collection; providing artifacts, documents, and photographs regarding Chateaugay's history that might otherwise have been discarded or lost.</p>

<p>Every item donated to our organization is accessioned, evaluated by a trained conservator (if appropriate), and then stored in our climate controlled storage areas using approved and accepted archival methods and materials.</p> 

<p>As our collection has grown, some objects have stood out for their significance and uniqueness.
For example, the oldest written artifact in our collection is a hand drawn map of the world drawn in 1800 by Gates Hoit. He was one of Chateaugay's most influential and consequential early citizens. He arrived with the first wave of settlers following the initial settlement by Nathan Beman and Benjamin Roberts in 1796.</p>

<p>Our archives now contain all of the Gates Hoit papers known to exist. The letters, deeds, ledgers and other documents are now in the process of being accessioned, sorted, conserved, scanned and transcribed so they can be made available to researchers. By scanning and transcribing them, they can be accessed for study without the need to constantly handle the fragile originals.</p>

<p>The first photo below is a high resolution scan of the Gates Hoit map. The second photo was written by Carrie Hoit McCoy. It explains the history, or the provenance, of the map. The writing is on a piece of brown paper that packaged the map when it was in storage in a trunk in the McCoy house on West Main Street.</p> 

<p>This map is just one small part of our constantly growing archival holdings. Thanks everyone for your continued and committed support of our organization.</p>

        <p>We have begun working on our next quarterly newsletter. We will have four articles in this issue:</p> 

<p><b>First,</b> we will tell the story of “Chateaugay” winning the Kentucky Derby in 1963 and how the horse came to be named after our town. </p>

<p><b>Second </b>will be about the life and times of Evelyn Nesbit Thaw, perhaps America’s first “supermodel”. She was a summer resident of Chateaugay Lake for a few years in the beginning of the last century. She always created a bit of a stir when she was here. She also made silent movies at the Lake when she was in residence at “Camp Jack” on the Upper Lake.</p>

<p><b>Third </b>will be the 1931 story of a 41 year old pitcher for the Chateaugay Ponies who pitched two complete game shutouts in 48 hours over the Fourth of July weekend and then played the outfield and went 3 for 5 just two days later. Talk about an “Iron Man” performance…</p>

<p><b>Fourth </b>will be the beginning of a series in which we will recognize the contributions of local veterans who served our country. Leading off this series will be the story of Walt Ouimet who served in WWII and again during the Korean War. He was a prisoner of war for 29 months during the Korean Conflict.</p>

<p>There is much to read on a variety of topics in this upcoming issue. The Publications Committee has begun editing the articles. We hope to go to print in the next two weeks. Stay tuned as we progress.</p>

<h3>OUR OTHER NEWS:</h3>
<p>We will be reopening to the public for our regular schedule beginning on Wednesday, July 7. We will be open every Wednesday and Saturday morning from 9am until noon, starting July 7 through Wednesday, September 29.</p>

<p>July 7 will also mark the opening of our first major exhibit in over 18 months. We are currently assembling the materials and objects for <b>“The History of Photography in Chateaugay.” </b>We have identified 25 photographers who have been associated with Chateaugay from the 1850s through 2021. We will have information about the photographers themselves, examples of their work, which will include many images of how Chateaugay has been portrayed over the years. Also, part of the exhibit will have examples of various photographic equipment and examples of different types of photographs.</p>

<p>In addition, our newly rearranged public research area will be open anyone wishing to do local history or genealogical research. Our public computers have been set up with website links and data files to aid any researcher. Also, our shelves of public materials have been updated and rearranged for easy and efficient use.</p>

<p>We have remained very busy during the COVID shutdown and we will be using the remaining weeks before July 7 to finish the photography exhibit, publish the newsletter and get the Archival Center ready for your visits and research. </p>

<p>Please stop by and see all that we have to offer beginning on July 7. And, as always, thank you for the tremendous support you have given us over the years.</p>

        <div class="blog-text">
        <p>We thought it was important to provide an update for our members and supporters of our efforts over the last year as we have been closed to the public.</p> 

<p>The past thirteen months have been challenging for the Chateaugay Historical Society as the COVID pandemic has been in our midst. We closed the Archival Center to the public in March of last year when the stay-at-home order went into effect. In fact, we mailed the first newsletter of 2020 just as the shutdown began.</p>

<p>Not knowing how long we would be closed, our first concern was how we would maintain our public presence since we wouldn’t be allowed to host our exhibits or plan public programs. Fortunately, we were able to continue our newsletter publication schedule and each issue has gone out more or less on time since March of 2020. We didn’t miss a single issue.</p> 

<p>Our posts on Facebook have continued to appear and the engagement with all the “Chateaugay Folks” out there has been amazing as always. We are always so in awe of the discussion threads that result from Facebook posts and how many memories and questions are triggered either by the topic or by the resulting comments.</p>

<p>As we have kept the newsletter and Facebook posts coming, much has happened behind the scenes. Research has continued for the many topics we hope to include in future issues of the newsletter. We have also taken the opportunity to put much effort into the Archival Center and have reconfigured our physical layout while greatly improving our storage capacity. During all that time, our archival collection has steadily grown. Object, photo, document and artifact donations have never really slowed as more and more generous people have come forward to help our repository of Chateaugay history become more complete and interesting.
To keep you all informed, here are some of the activities we have worked on over the past year: </p>

<p>A staircase was built to our upper level storage area and that space has been outfitted with archival safe racks. It now houses collection storage supplies and parts of our accessioned archives. </p>

<p>We now have a flat-file map case unit to store larger flat objects and documents. One of the first collection pieces that was added to the map case was our assortment of local War of 1812 artifacts. During that war, between five and six thousand American troops (both regular army and militia) were staged in Chateaugay for about a month prior to the invasion into Canada and the Battle of Chateauguay (Quebec). The artifacts located so far seem to have come from small encampments of soldiers (perhaps as few as ten). The large camps of hundreds of troops haven’t been found yet but we know those locations are still out there.</p>

<p>We have had two more of our J.W. Gray oil paintings restored by Phillips Art Conservation of Essex, NY. Emily Phillips’ expertise has led to the paintings being cleaned, repaired and reconditioned. They are spectacular!</p>

<p>We also took the closed time as an opportunity to rearrange our main space in the Archival Center. Our office space is now adjacent to our storage room and upper level stairway. We have three computer stations within the office area. One is dedicated primarily to accessioning our collection, one is for working with our rapidly growing photo archives and the third is being utilized in the many scanning projects we have underway. Scanning of letters, old ledgers and diaries (primarily the Gates Hoit papers which date back to the early 1800s) will allow us to have them available for research without having to handle the actual documents. Out stand scanner has proven invaluable in this process.</p>

<p>We have also relocated our two public computers to the front corner of the Archival Center. Each machine has a dedicated printer and has databases and bookmarks ready for local history or family history researchers once we reopen.</p>

<p>Thanks to trustee Katelyn Legacy-Roulston, we now have our own website. During the pandemic, Katelyn developed the format and content now available at www.chateaugayhistory.org The website is a true work in progress as we talk about what we can add, how we can better tell Chateaugay’s story, and what (and how) to add resources for folks to access and explore. Her expertise and efforts have been invaluable.</p>

<p>In spite of the challenges to instruction (with virtual or hybrid class attendance, etc.), we were able to contribute to the annual WWII/Pearl Harbor exhibit at CCS this past fall. This is an ongoing project spearheaded and funded by Chateaugay native, Joe Ryan. Shannon Wiese, the 11th and 12th grade Social Studies teacher, developed a small exhibit commemorating Pearl Harbor last December and is following that up with a planned virtual exhibit this spring as she engages her students with this topic in these challenging instructional times.</p>

<p>As you can see, we have kept busy behind the scenes over the last thirteen months. Suffice it to say, none of this would have been possible without the generosity and support of our members and benefactors.</p> 

<p>As reopening the Archival Center appears on the horizon, we are working on a public exhibit for this summer which will be presented with all the appropriate recommended public health guidelines. The topic will be “Photographers Associated with Chateaugay” over the years. Two dozen photographers will be profiled and examples of their work will be shown. In addition, we will have a display of cameras and other photographic equipment that will illustrate the history and development of these devices. More details regarding exhibit opening, hours, etc. will be posted both on our website and here on Facebook as we progress and as opening guidelines develop.</p>

<p>Again, we are humbled and grateful for all the support our members continue to show us. Your emotional and financial support have allowed us to become far more than we expected we would be since our founding back in 2007. We constantly strive to do your support proud and to preserve and present Chateaugay’s story whenever we can. Thanks.</p>
